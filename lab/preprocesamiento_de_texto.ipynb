&quothypothyroidism&quot i was recently diagnosed with the disease and i am struggling to figure out what it is and how i got it my name and address is [name] [location] [contact] thank you in advance for your help', 'ANSWER': [\"the thyroid gland is an important organ of the endocrine system it is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet the thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy this process is called metabolism   hypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50  the most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis swelling and inflammation damage the thyroid gland's cells   causes of this problem include   - the immune system attacking the thyroid gland  - viral infections (common cold) or other respiratory infections  - pregnancy (often called postpartum thyroiditis)    other causes of hypothyroidism include  - certain medicines such as lithium and amiodarone  - congenital (birth) defects  - radiation treatments to the neck or brain to treat different cancers  - radioactive iodine used to treat an overactive thyroid gland  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid gland  - sheehan syndrome a condition that may occur in a woman who bleeds severely during pregnancy or childbirth and causes the destruction of the pituitary gland  - pituitary tumor or pituitary surgery\", 'hypothyroidism has several causes including                  - hashimoto’s disease  - thyroiditis or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications                  less commonly hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland                  hashimoto’s disease                  hashimoto’s disease also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the united states1\\xa0 hashimoto’s disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland\\xa0 hashimoto’s disease is also an autoimmune disorder                  normally the immune system protects the body against foreign invaders—such as viruses and bacteria—that can cause illness\\xa0 but in autoimmune diseases the immune system attacks the body’s own cells and organs\\xa0 with hashimoto’s disease the immune system attacks the thyroid causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones                  more information is provided in the niddk health topic hashimoto’s disease                  thyroiditis                  thyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland\\xa0 at first the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood leading to hyperthyroidism—when thyroid hormone levels are too high––that lasts for 1 or 2 months\\xa0 most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed                  several types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism                  - subacute thyroiditis this condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid\\xa0 experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection\\xa0 the condition usually goes away on its own in a few months  - postpartum thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth\\xa0 for more information see the section titled “what happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions”  - silent thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis is called “silent” because it is painless as is postpartum thyroiditis even though the thyroid may be enlarged\\xa0 like postpartum thyroiditis silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism                  congenital hypothyroidism                  some babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly\\xa0 if untreated congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure\\xa0 early treatment can prevent these complications so most newborns in the united states are screened for hypothyroidism                  surgical removal of the thyroid                  when part of the thyroid is removed the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism\\xa0 removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism                  part or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for                  - hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules which are noncancerous tumors called adenomas or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer                  radiation treatment of the thyroid                  radioactive iodine a common treatment for hyperthyroidism gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid\\xa0 most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism\\xa0 people with hodgkin’s disease other lymphomas and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation which can also damage the thyroid                  medications                  some drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism including                  - amiodarone a heart

asleep and stay asleep                  a type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia anxiety tends to prolong insomnia                  several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule however if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible)                  lifestyle changes                  if you have insomnia avoid substances that make it worse such as                  caffeine tobacco and other stimulants the effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours                  certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example some cold and allergy medicines) talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep                  alcohol an alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep however alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal this makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night                  try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed for example read a book listen to soothing music or take a hot bath                  try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime                  make your bedroom sleep-friendly avoid bright lighting while winding down try to limit possible distractions such as a tv computer or pet make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable your bedroom also should be dark and quiet                  go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning even on weekends if you can avoid night shifts alternating schedules or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule                  cognitive-behavioral therapy                  cbt for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep this therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety                  for example relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety these strategies help you better control your breathing heart rate muscles and mood                  cbt also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep this method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time                  cbt also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep this method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look feel and sound the goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing                  cbt also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake this method involves setting a sleep schedule at first you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep                  this schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep however the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly over time the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep                  for success with cbt you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months cbt works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia it also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone                  for people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder cbt combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions                  medicines                  prescription medicines                  many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia some are meant for short-term use while others are meant for longer use                  talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines for example insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them                  rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating sleep walking or driving while asleep if you have side effects from an insomnia medicine or if it doesn't work well tell your doctor he or she might prescribe a different medicine                  some insomnia medicines can be habit forming ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines

the pupils which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye do not react normally to light instead they expand and contract more slowly than normal or they may not respond to light at all additionally the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin a condition known as keratoconus  a specific behavior called franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of leber congenital amaurosis this sign consists of poking pressing and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to deep-set eyes and keratoconus in affected children  in rare cases delayed development and intellectual disability have been reported in people with the features of leber

in the blood diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas the pancreas releases insulin into the blood insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should glucose can't get into your cells it stays in your blood instead your blood glucose level then gets too high causing pre-diabetes or diabetes types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes type 1 type 2 and gestational diabetes the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same glucose builds up in the blood while the cells are starved of energy over the years high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease stroke blindness kidney disease nerve problems gum infections and amputation type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes develops most often in young people however type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults with this form of diabetes your body no longer makes insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes to survive people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump learn more about type 1 diabetes here type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes is the most common form of diabetes although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance—a condition that occurs when fat muscle and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the body’s cells to use for energy as a result the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells at first the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin over time the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase such as after meals if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes learn more about type 2 diabetes here gestational diabetes some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life prediabetes prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke the good news is that if you have prediabetes you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes  learn more about prediabetes here  signs of diabetes many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms including extreme thirst or hunger a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue some lose weight without trying additional signs include sores that heal slowly dry itchy skin loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight some people with diabetes however have no symptoms at all how many have diabetes nearly 29 million americans age 20 or older (123 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes according to 2014 estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 19 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone people can get diabetes at any age but the risk increases as we get older in 2014 over 11 million older adults living in the us -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes see more statistics about diabetes from the  national diabetes statistics report 2014 (centers for disease control and prevention) if diabetes is not managed diabetes is a very serious disease over time diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes kidneys nerves heart gums and teeth if you have diabetes you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke people with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others the best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose blood pressure and cholesterol and to

move through the atrioventricular node during each heartbeat stimulating the ventricles to contract slightly later than the atria  people with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome are born with an extra connection in the heart called an accessory pathway that allows electrical signals to bypass the atrioventricular node and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than usual the accessory pathway may also transmit electrical impulses abnormally from the ventricles back to the atria this extra connection can disrupt the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart leading to an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other arrhythmias resulting symptoms include dizziness a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) shortness of breath and fainting (syncope) in rare cases arrhythmias associated with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death the most common arrhythmia associated with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  complications of wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can occur at any age although some individuals born with an accessory pathway in the heart never experience any health problems associated with the condition  wolff-parkinson-white syndrome often occurs with other structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease the most common heart defect associated with the condition is ebstein anomaly which affects the valve that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle (the tricuspid valve) additionally wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can be a component of several other genetic syndromes including hypokalemic periodic paralysis (a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness) pompe disease (a disorder characterized by the storage of excess glycogen) and tuberous sclerosis (a condition that results in the growth of noncancerous tumors in many parts of the body)\"], 'FOCUS':

research for salivary gland dysfunction scientists at nih’s national institute of dental and craniofacial research (nidcr) are exploring the potential use of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction the idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose salivary glands were damaged during radiation treatment the hope is that these genes will increase the production of saliva and eliminate the chronic parched sensation that bothers people with dry mouth conditions nidcr recently completed a clinical study a research study in humans on gene therapy for radiation-damaged salivary glands the study showed that gene therapy can be safely performed in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth read nidcr’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings based on the promising results of this trial similar clinical trials are planned in the near future research on sjögren’s syndrome and other diseases affecting salivary glands nidcr is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with sjogren’s syndrome such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes auto inflammatory diseases and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland dysfunction such studies could one day lead to

there may be no symptoms many of the symptoms of leukemia don't become apparent until a large number of normal blood cells are crowded out by leukemia cells symptoms of chronic and acute leukemia in chronic leukemia symptoms develop gradually and in the beginning are generally not as severe as in acute leukemia chronic leukemia is usually found during a routine doctor's exam before symptoms are present when symptoms appear they generally are mild at first and gradually get worse but sometimes they don't worsen until many years after an initial diagnosis recently researchers discovered that abnormal white blood cells can be present in the blood of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients a number of years before a diagnosis this finding may lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes that occur in the earliest stages of the disease and how the disease progresses in acute leukemia symptoms usually appear and get worse quickly people with this disease usually go to their doctor because they feel sick white blood cell levels may be high people with leukemia may have very high levels of white blood cells but because the cells are abnormal they are unable to fight infection therefore patients may develop frequent fevers or infections a shortage of red blood cells called anemia can cause a person to feel tired not having enough blood platelets may cause a person to bleed and bruise easily some symptoms depend on where leukemia cells collect in the body leukemia cells can collect in many different tissues and organs such as the digestive tract kidneys lungs lymph nodes or other parts of the body including the eyes brain and testicles other common symptoms other common symptoms of leukemia include headache weight loss pain in the bones or joints swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen) and swollen lymph nodes especially in the neck or armpit symptoms of acute leukemia may include vomiting confusion loss of muscle control and seizures some of the symptoms of leukemia are similar to those caused by the flu or other common diseases so these symptoms are not sure signs of leukemia it is important to check with your doctor if you have these symptoms only a doctor can diagnose and treat leukemia diagnosing leukemia physical exam blood tests biopsy to find the cause of leukemia symptoms the doctor will ask about medical history and conduct a physical exam during the exam the doctor will check for signs of disease such as lumps swelling in the lymph nodes spleen and liver or anything else that seems unusual the doctor will need to do blood tests that check the levels and types of blood cells and look for changes in the shape of blood cells the doctor also may look at certain factors in the blood to see if leukemia has affected other organs such as the liver or kidneys even if blood tests suggest leukemia the doctor may look for signs of leukemia in the bone marrow by doing a biopsy before making a diagnosis a biopsy is a procedure where a small amount of bone marrow is removed from a bone a pathologist examines the sample under a microscope to look for abnormal cells there are two ways the doctor can obtain bone marrow in a bone marrow aspiration marrow is collected by inserting a needle into the hipbone or another large bone and removing a small amount of bone marrow a bone marrow biopsy is performed with a larger needle and removes bone marrow and a small piece of bone if leukemia cells are found if leukemia cells are found in the bone marrow sample the doctor may perform more tests to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body the doctor may collect a sample of the fluid around the brain and spinal cord by performing a spinal tap and checking for leukemia cells or other signs of problems computed tomography (ct) scans and ultrasounds are tests used to determine if leukemia has spread from the bone marrow these tests produce pictures of the inside of the body

surgery called radical prostatectomy or in some cases remove only part of it sometimes the surgeon will also remove nearby lymph nodes side effects of the operation may include lack of sexual function or impotence or problems holding urine or incontinence improvements in surgery now make it possible for some men to keep their sexual function in some cases doctors can use a technique known as

the most common triggers are wood dust grain dust animal dander fungi or chemicals  many people with asthma have a personal or family history of allergies such as hay fever (allergic rhinitis) or eczema others have no history of allergies', \"the exact cause of asthma isn't known researchers think some genetic and environmental factors interact to cause asthma most often early in life these

atopy runs in your family exposure to irritants (for example tobacco smoke) may make your airways more reactive to substances in the air                  some factors may be more likely to cause asthma in some people than in others researchers continue to explore what causes asthma                  the hygiene hypothesis                  one theory researchers have for what causes asthma is the hygiene hypothesis they believe that our western lifestyle—with its emphasis on hygiene and sanitation—has resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood                  many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past this affects the way that young children's

chromosome the resulting child will have a single x chromosome in each cell mosaic turner syndrome occurring when a person has some cells with one x chromosome and some cells with two sex chromosomes is also not inherited this also occurs due to a random event during early fetal development rather than before conception in rare cases turner syndrome may be caused by a missing piece (partial deletion) of the x chromosome a deletion can be inherited from a parent genetic testing of an affected fetus or child can identify the type of turner syndrome present and may help to estimate the risk of recurrence people with questions about genetic testing or recurrence risks for turner syndrome are encouraged to speak with a genetic counselor or other genetics professional', \"most cases of turner syndrome are not inherited when this condition results from monosomy x the chromosomal abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in the affected person's parent an error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes for example an egg or sperm cell may lose a sex chromosome as a result of nondisjunction if one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child the child will have a single x chromosome in each cell and will be missing the other sex chromosome  mosaic turner syndrome is also not inherited in an affected individual it occurs as a random event during cell division in early fetal development as a result some of an affected person's cells have the usual two sex chromosomes and other cells have only one copy of the x chromosome other sex chromosome abnormalities are also possible in females with x chromosome

only have one x chromosome and lack the protective effect of the extra x chromosome they are more severely affected \\xa0people with x-ald accumulate high levels of saturated very long chain fatty acids (vlcfa) in the brain and adrenal cortex the loss of myelin and the progressive dysfunction of the adrenal gland are the primary characteristics of x-ald while nearly all patients with x-ald suffer from adrenal insufficiency also known as addison's disease the neurological symptoms can begin either in childhood or in adulthood the childhood cerebral form is the most severe with onset between ages 4 and 10 the most common symptoms are usually behavioral changes such as abnormal withdrawal or aggression poor memory and poor school performance other symptoms include visual loss learning disabilities seizures poorly articulated speech difficulty swallowing deafness disturbances of gait and coordination fatigue intermittent vomiting increased skin pigmentation and progressive dementia the milder adult-onset form is also known as adrenomyeloneuropathy (amn) which typically begins between ages 21 and 35 \\xa0symptoms may include progressive stiffness weakness or paralysis of the lower limbs and ataxia although adult-onset ald progresses more slowly than the classic childhood form it can also result in deterioration of brain function almost half the women who are carriers of x-als will develop a milder form of amn but almost never will develop symptoms seen in boys the x-ald \\xa0x-ald should not be confused with neonatal adrenoleukodsystrophy which is a disease of

be strained so the stone can be saved and tested  - drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine this will help the stone pass  - pain can be very bad over-the-counter pain medicines (for example ibuprofen and naproxen) either alone or along with narcotics can be very effective    some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital you may need to get fluids through a vein  for some types of stones your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone these medicines can include  - allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - diuretics  - phosphate solutions  - sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    surgery is often needed if  - the stone is too large to pass on its own  - the stone is growing  - the stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - the pain cannot be controlled     today most treatments are much less invasive than in the past  - lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter it uses sound or shock waves to break up stones then the stone fragments leave the body in the urine it is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or eswl  - procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed the stone is removed with a tube (endoscope)  - ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract  - rarely

have osteoporosis or are at high risk due to low bone mass placing them at risk for more serious bone loss and fractures although osteoporosis can strike at any age it is most common among older people especially older women how bone loss occurs bone is living tissue throughout our lives the body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone but as people age more bone is broken down than is replaced the inside of a bone normally looks like a honeycomb but when a person has osteoporosis the spaces inside this honeycomb become larger reflecting the loss of bone density and strength

for bone health is to keep as much bone as possible for as long as you can in most women the rate of bone loss increases for several years after menopause then slows down again but continues in men the bone loss occurs more slowly but by age 65 or 70 most men and women are losing bone at the same rate weak bones can lead to fractures osteoporosis is often called silent because bone loss occurs without symptoms people may not know that they have osteoporosis until a sudden strain bump or fall causes a bone to break this can result in a trip to the hospital surgery and possibly a long-term

get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old                  a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds

deciding which asthma medicines are best for you he or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you then he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed                  asthma medicines can be taken in pill form but most are taken using a device called an inhaler an inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs                  not all inhalers are used the same way ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit                  long-term control medicines                  most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms the most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation which helps prevent symptoms from starting these medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms                  inhaled corticosteroids inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma they're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances                  reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur                  inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed these medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming even if you take them every day for many years                  like many other medicines though inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects                  one common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush you might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush these devices attach to your inhaler they help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat                  check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have also work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush                  if you have severe asthma you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control                  if taken for long periods these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (os-te-o-po-ro-sis) a cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break                  your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids or your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin d pills to protect your bones                  other long-term control medicines other long-term control medicines include                  cromolyn this medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer as you breathe in the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation                  omalizumab (anti-ige) this medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month it helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers such as pollen and dust mites anti-ige might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well                  \\xa0a rare but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the omalizumab injection is given if you take this medication work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you \\xa0should take                  inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists these medicines open the airways they might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control they must used with inhaled corticosteroids                  leukotriene modifiers these medicines are taken by mouth they help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways                  theophylline this medicine is taken by mouth theophylline helps open the airways                  if your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine take it every day to control your asthma your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine                  long-term control medicines can have side effects talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them                  with some medicines like theophylline your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood this helps ensure that you’re getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects                  quick-relief medicines                  all people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief                  these medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup this allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them                  you should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms if you use this medicine more than 2 days a week talk with your doctor about your asthma control you may need to make changes to your asthma action plan                  carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it if your child has asthma make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines including staff at the child's school they should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child                  you shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation                  track your asthma                  to track your asthma keep records of your symptoms check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter and get regular asthma checkups                  record your symptoms                  you can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma                  asthma is well controlled if                  you have symptoms no more than 2 days a week and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month                  you can do all your normal activities                  you take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week                  you have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth                  your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number                  if your asthma isn't well controlled contact your doctor he or she may need to change your asthma action plan                  use a peak flow meter                  this small hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs you blow into the device and it gives you a score or peak flow number your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test                  your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter he or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score                  your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results you may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you                  when you're first diagnosed with asthma it's important to find your personal best peak flow number to do this you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled the highest number you get during that time is your personal best you can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled                  your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack even before you notice symptoms if your score shows that your breathing is getting worse you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked                  get asthma checkups                  when you first begin treatment you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks once your asthma is controlled your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year                  during these checkups your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements he or she also may ask about your daily activities this information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control                  your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan based on your answers to these questions your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine                  if your control is very good you might be able to take less medicine the goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma                  emergency care                  most people who have asthma including many children can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans however you might need medical attention at times                  call your doctor for advice if                  your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack                  your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number                  call 9–1–1 for emergency care if                  you have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath                  you have blue lips or fingernails                  at

treatment for special groups                  the treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma however some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs                  children                  it's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years thus it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines (quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not)                  doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if after assessing a child they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age (for more information go to how is asthma diagnosed)                  inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children montelukast and cromolyn are other options treatment might be given for a trial period of 1\\xa0month to 6 weeks treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly                  inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment is generally small and doesn't get worse over time poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate                  many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth                  older adults                  doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines such as beta blockers aspirin and other pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medicines these medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms                  be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including over-the-counter medicines                  older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids especially at high doses talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin d pills as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong                  pregnant women                  pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight                  studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack                  talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed                  people whose asthma symptoms occur with physical activity                  physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle adults need physical activity to maintain good health children need it for growth and development                  in some people however physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms if this happens to you or your child talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active                  the following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity                  short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them                  long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours however with daily use they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection also frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled                  leukotriene modifiers these pills are taken several hours before physical activity they can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity                  long-term control medicines frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation this will help prevent exercise-related symptoms                  easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful you also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather                  if you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose                  people having surgery

unhealthy or you do them without thinking you need to be motivated to make lifestyle changes make the behavior change part of your life over the long term know that it takes time to make and keep a change in your lifestyle  work with your health care provider and dietitian to set realistic safe daily calorie counts that help you lose weight while staying healthy remember that if you drop pounds slowly and steadily you are more likely to keep them off your dietitian can teach you about  - healthy food choices  - healthy snacks  - reading nutrition labels  - new ways to prepare food  - portion sizes  - sweetened drinks    extreme diets (fewer than 1100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well these types of diets often do not contain enough vitamins and minerals

stressed a lot talk to your provider    medicines and herbal remedies   you may see ads for supplements and herbal remedies that claim they will help you lose weight some of these claims may not be true and some of these supplements can have serious side effects talk to your provider before using them  you can discuss weight loss medicines with your doctor many people lose at least 5 pounds by taking these drugs but they may regain the weight when they stop taking the medicine unless they have made lifestyle changes   surgery   bariatric (weight-loss) surgery can reduce the risk of certain

'ANSWER': 'meesmann corneal dystrophy is an eye disease that affects the cornea which is the clear front covering of the eye this condition is characterized by the formation of tiny round cysts in the outermost layer of the cornea called the corneal epithelium this part of the cornea acts as a barrier to help prevent foreign materials such as dust and bacteria from entering the eye  in people with meesmann corneal dystrophy cysts can appear as early as the first year of life they usually affect both eyes and increase in number over time the cysts usually do not cause any symptoms until late adolescence or adulthood when they start to break open (rupture) on the surface of the cornea and cause irritation the resulting symptoms typically include increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) twitching of the eyelids (blepharospasm) increased tear production the sensation of having a foreign object in the eye and an inability to tolerate wearing contact lenses some affected individuals

skin all over the body depigmentation typically occurs on the face neck and scalp and around body openings such as the mouth and genitals sometimes pigment is lost in mucous membranes such as the lips

vomiting — between 30 and 90 percent of patients develop nausea and vomiting after r-chop several medications may be given before and after chemotherapy to reduce its severity this often includes dexamethasone and aprepitant (emend) and a 5-ht3 receptor antagonist (eg ondansetron/zofran granisetron/kytril dolasetron/anzemet palonosetron/aloxi or tropisetron/navoban)   ●hypersensitivity

the breastbone to the top of the pubic bone the surgeon then clamps off the aorta cuts open the aneurysm and sews in a graft to act as a bridge for the blood flow the blood flow then goes through the plastic graft and no longer allows the direct pulsation pressure of the blood to further expand the weak aorta wall  interventional repair - this minimally invasive technique is performed by an interventional radiologist using imaging to guide the catheter and graft inside the patient's artery for the procedure an incision is made in the skin at the groin through which a catheter is passed

understanding the genetics of friedreich's ataxia are leading to breakthroughs in treatment research has moved forward to the point where clinical trials of proposed treatments are presently occurring for friedreich’s ataxia  what research is being done   within the federal government the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) a component of the national institutes of health (nih) has primary responsibility for sponsoring research on neurological disorders as part of this mission the ninds conducts research on friedreich's ataxia and other forms of inherited ataxias at its facilities at the nih and supports additional studies at medical centers throughout the united states several nonprofit organizations also provide substantial support research (see the section on where can i get more information)   researchers are optimistic that they have begun to understand the causes of the disease and work has begun to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies for friedreich's ataxia scientists have been able to create various models of the disease in yeast and mice which have facilitated understanding the cause of the disease and are now being used for drug discovery and the development of novel treatments   studies have revealed that frataxin is an important mitochondrial protein for proper function of several organs yet in people with the disease the amount of frataxin in affected cells is severely reduced it is believed that the loss of frataxin makes the nervous system heart and pancreas particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals (produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen) once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to this damage free radicals have been implicated in other degenerative diseases such as parkinson's and alzheimer's diseases   based upon this information scientists and physicians have tried to reduce the levels of free radicals also called oxidants using treatment with “antioxidants” initial clinical studies in europe suggested that antioxidants like coenzyme q10 vitamin e and idebenone may offer individuals some limited benefit however recent clinical trials in the united states and europe have not revealed effectiveness of idebenone in people with friedreich’s ataxia but more powerful modified forms of this agent and other antioxidants are in trials at this time there is also a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of selectively removing excess iron from the mitochondria   scientists also are exploring ways to increase frataxin levels through drug treatments genetic engineering and protein delivery systems several compounds that are directed at increasing levels of frataxin may be brought to clinical trials in the near future to check for current trials visit http//wwwclinicaltrialsgov additional information is available from the groups listed in the following section   armed with what they currently know about frataxin and friedreich’s ataxia scientists are working to better define fraxatin’s role clarify how defects in iron

after an evaluation and before beginning hormonal therapy you and your gynecology (gyn) team may decide to keep track of your symptoms and try mild pain medicine this is usually the first step for girls with premenarcheal endometriosis (who are too young to have had their first period)  medical suppression hormonal treatment such as birth control pills containing estrogen and progesterone taken continuously (to stop periods) relieves symptoms in many patients a second treatment is progesterone medicine alone this comes as a progestin–only birth control pill in a pill pack (nor–qd® or camilla®) or as a regular pill that comes in a bottle norethindrone acetate (aygestin®)  the dose of aygestin® can be adjusted for your body to stop your pain and bleeding another type of medication is a gnrh agonist such as leuprolide acetate (lupron–depot®) this medicine works by shutting off hormones made by the ovaries and temporarily stops your period the use of gnrh agonist therapy lowers your body’s estrogen level (one of the hormones that causes your body to have periods)  surgery visible endometriosis will be destroyed at the time of laparoscopy after this procedure many teens find relief from symptoms most say that their pain is better but not completely gone remember there is no cure for endometriosis many teens may experience pain again  lifestyle changes dealing with chronic pelvic pain can be challenging exercising often helps to relieve or lessen pelvic pain and menstrual cramps eating a balanced diet and getting enough rest also helps your body manage pain practicing

congestive heart failure is a major cause of progressive chronic kidney disease uncontrolled congestive heart failure is often associated with a rapid fall in renal function and adequate control of congestive heart failure can prevent this the opposite is also true treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure there is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect

called cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia anxiety tends to prolong insomnia                  several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule however if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible)                  lifestyle changes                  if you have insomnia avoid substances that make it worse such as                  caffeine tobacco and other stimulants the effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours                  certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example some cold and allergy medicines) talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep                  alcohol an alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep however alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal this makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night                  try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed for example read a book listen to soothing music or take a hot bath                  try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime                  make your bedroom sleep-friendly avoid bright lighting while winding down try to limit possible distractions such as a tv computer or pet make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable your bedroom also should be dark and quiet                  go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning even on weekends if you can avoid night shifts alternating schedules or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule                  cognitive-behavioral therapy                  cbt for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep this therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety                  for example relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety these strategies help you better control your breathing heart rate muscles and mood                  cbt also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep this method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time                  cbt also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep this method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look feel and sound the goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing                  cbt also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake this method involves setting a sleep schedule at first you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep                  this schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep however the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly over time the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep                  for success with cbt you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months cbt works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia it also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone                  for people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder cbt combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions                  medicines                  prescription medicines                  many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia some are meant for short-term use while others are meant for longer use                  talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines for example insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them                  rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating sleep walking or driving while asleep if you have side effects from an insomnia medicine or if it doesn't work well tell your doctor he or she might prescribe a different medicine                  some insomnia medicines can be habit forming ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines                  over-the-counter products                  some over-the-counter (otc) products claim to treat insomnia these products include melatonin l-tryptophan supplements and valerian teas or extracts                  the food and drug administration doesn't regulate “natural” products and some food supplements thus the dose and purity of these substances can vary how well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood                  some otc products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids although these products might make you sleepy talk to your doctor before taking them                  antihistamines pose risks for some people also these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you\",\n",

       "    \"too much glucose in the blood diabetes means your blood glucose (often called blood sugar) is too high your blood always has some glucose in it because your body needs glucose for energy to keep you going but too much glucose in the blood isn't good for your health glucose comes from the food you eat and is also made in your liver and muscles your blood carries the glucose to all of the cells in your body insulin is a chemical (a hormone) made by the pancreas the pancreas releases insulin into the blood insulin helps the glucose from food get into your cells if your body does not make enough insulin or if the insulin doesn't work the way it should glucose can't get into your cells it stays in your blood instead your blood glucose level then gets too high causing pre-diabetes or diabetes types of diabetes there are three main kinds of diabetes type 1 type 2 and gestational diabetes the result of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is the same glucose builds up in the blood while the cells are starved of energy over the years high blood glucose damages nerves and blood vessels oftentimes leading to complications such as heart disease stroke blindness kidney disease nerve problems gum infections and amputation type 1 diabetes type 1 diabetes which used to be called called juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes develops most often in young people however type 1 diabetes can also develop in adults with this form of diabetes your body no longer makes insulin or doesn’t make enough insulin because your immune system has attacked and destroyed the insulin-producing cells about 5 to 10 percent of people with diabetes have type 1 diabetes to survive people with type 1 diabetes must have insulin delivered by injection or a pump learn more about type 1 diabetes here type 2 diabetes type 2 diabetes which used to be called adult-onset diabetes or non insulin-dependent diabetes is the most common form of diabetes although people can develop type 2 diabetes at any age -- even during childhood -- type 2 diabetes develops most often in middle-aged and older people type 2 diabetes usually begins with insulin resistance—a condition that occurs when fat muscle and liver cells do not use insulin to carry glucose into the body’s cells to use for energy as a result the body needs more insulin to help glucose enter cells at first the pancreas keeps up with the added demand by making more insulin over time the pancreas doesn’t make enough insulin when blood sugar levels increase such as after meals if your pancreas can no longer make enough insulin you will need to treat your type 2 diabetes learn more about type 2 diabetes here gestational diabetes some women develop gestational diabetes during the late stages of pregnancy gestational diabetes is caused by the hormones of pregnancy or a shortage of insulin although this form of diabetes usually goes away after the baby is born a woman who has had it and her child are more likely to develop diabetes later in life prediabetes prediabetes means your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of diabetes people with prediabetes are at an increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes and for heart disease and stroke the good news is that if you have prediabetes you can reduce your risk of getting type 2 diabetes with modest weight loss and moderate physical activity you can delay or prevent type 2 diabetes  learn more about prediabetes here  signs of diabetes many people with diabetes experience one or more symptoms including extreme thirst or hunger a frequent need to urinate and/or fatigue some lose weight without trying additional signs include sores that heal slowly dry itchy skin loss of feeling or tingling in the feet and blurry eyesight some people with diabetes however have no symptoms at all how many have diabetes nearly 29 million americans age 20 or older (123 percent of all people in this age group) have diabetes according to 2014 estimates from the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) about 19 million people aged 20 years or older were newly diagnosed with diabetes in 2010 alone people can get diabetes at any age but the risk increases as we get older in 2014 over 11 million older adults living in the us -- nearly 26 percent of people 65 or older -- had diabetes see more statistics about diabetes from the  national diabetes statistics report 2014 (centers for disease control and prevention) if diabetes is not managed diabetes is a very serious disease over time diabetes that is not well managed causes serious damage to the eyes kidneys nerves heart gums and teeth if you have diabetes you are more likely than people without diabetes to have heart disease or a stroke people with diabetes also tend to develop heart disease or stroke at an earlier age than others the best way to protect yourself from the serious complications of diabetes is to manage your blood glucose

most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day  - if your blood sugar level is under control you may only need to check it a few times a week  - you may test yourself when you wake up before meals and at bedtime  - you may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress    keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor based on your numbers you may need to make changes to your meals activity or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range   healthy eating and weight control  work closely with your doctor nurse and dietitian to learn how much fat protein and carbohydrates you need in your diet your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like  managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight this does not mean that their diabetes is cured they still have diabetes  very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery  regular physical activity  regular activity is important for everyone it is even more important when you have diabetes exercise is good for your health because it  - lowers your blood sugar level without medicine  - burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight  - improves blood flow and blood pressure  - increases your energy level  - improves your ability to handle stress    talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program people with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before during and after physical activity or exercise   medications to treat diabetes  if diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels your doctor may prescribe medication since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways your doctor may have you take more than one drug  some of the most common types of medication are listed below they are taken by mouth or injection  - alpha-glucosidase inhibitors  - biguanides  - dpp iv inhibitors  - injectable medicines (glp-1 analogs)  - meglitinides  - sgl t2 inhibitors  - sulfonylureas  - thiazolidinediones    you may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe insulin pen or pump it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin  preventing complications  your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes including   - eye disease  - kidney disease  - heart disease and stroke   foot care  people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems diabetes damages the nerves this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot you many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection  diabetes can also damage blood vessels small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers) the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger deeper or infected  to prevent problems with your feet  - stop smoking if you smoke  - improve control of your blood sugar  - get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year and learn if you have nerve damage  - check and care for your feet every day this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems  -

       "   'ANSWER': 'treatment depends on the type of stone and the severity of your symptoms  kidney stones that are small most often pass through your system on their own   - your urine should be strained so the stone can be saved and tested  - drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water per day to produce a large amount of urine this will help the stone pass  - pain can be very bad over-the-counter pain medicines (for example ibuprofen and naproxen) either alone or along with narcotics can be very effective    some people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital you may need to get fluids through a vein  for some types of stones your provider may prescribe medicine to prevent stones from forming or help break down and remove the material that is causing the stone these medicines can include  - allopurinol (for uric acid stones)  - antibiotics (for struvite stones)  - diuretics  - phosphate solutions  - sodium bicarbonate or sodium citrate  - water pills (thiazide diuretics)  - tamsulosin to relax the ureter and help the stone pass    surgery is often needed if  - the stone is too large to pass on its own  - the stone is growing  - the stone is blocking urine flow and causing an infection or kidney damage  - the pain cannot be controlled     today most treatments are much less invasive than in the past  - lithotripsy is used to remove stones slightly smaller than a half an inch that are located in the kidney or ureter it uses sound or shock waves to break up stones then the stone fragments leave the body in the urine it is also called extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy or eswl  - procedures performed by passing a special instrument through a small surgical cut in your skin and into your kidney or ureters are used for large stones or when the kidneys or surrounding areas are incorrectly formed the stone is removed with a tube (endoscope)  - ureteroscopy may be used for stones in the lower urinary tract  - rarely open surgery (nephrolithotomy) may be needed if other methods do not work or are not possible    talk to your provider about what treatment options may work for you',\n",

tests                  lung function test                  your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-rom-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working this test measures how much air you can breathe in and out it also measures how fast you can blow air out                  your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved

other tests                  your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis other tests may include                  allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you if any                  a test to measure how sensitive your airways are this is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-ko-prav-eh-ka-shun) test using spirometry this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in                  a test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma such as reflux disease vocal cord dysfunction or sleep apnea                  a chest x ray or an ekg (electrocardiogram) these tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms                  diagnosing asthma in young children                  most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age however asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose                  sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition this is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions                  also many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old                  a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections the airways grow as the child grows older so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds                  a young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if                  one or both parents have asthma                  the child has signs of allergies including the allergic skin condition eczema                  the child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens                  the child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection                  the most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test a medical history and a physical exam however it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years thus doctors must rely on children's medical histories signs and symptoms and physical exams to make a diagnosis                  doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds\"],\n",

           asthma medicines can be taken in pill form but most are taken using a device called an inhaler an inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs                  not all inhalers are used the same way ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit                  long-term control medicines                  most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms the most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation which helps prevent symptoms from starting these medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms                  inhaled corticosteroids inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma they're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances                  reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur                  inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed these medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming even if you take them every day for many years                  like many other medicines though inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects                  one common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush you might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush these devices attach to your inhaler they help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat                  check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have also work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush                  if you have severe asthma you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control                  if taken for long periods these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (os-te-o-po-ro-sis) a cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break                  your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids or your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin d pills to protect your bones                  other long-term control medicines other long-term control medicines include                  cromolyn this medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer as you breathe in the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation                  omalizumab (anti-ige) this medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month it helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers such as pollen and dust mites anti-ige might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well                  \\xa0a rare but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the omalizumab injection is given if you take this medication work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you \\xa0should take                  inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists these medicines open the airways they might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control they must used with inhaled corticosteroids                  leukotriene modifiers these medicines are taken by mouth they help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways                  theophylline this medicine is taken by mouth theophylline helps open the airways                  if your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine take it every day to control your asthma your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine                  long-term control medicines can have side effects talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them                  with some medicines like theophylline your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood this helps ensure that you’re getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects                  quick-relief medicines                  all people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief                  these medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup this allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them                  you should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms if you use this medicine more than 2 days a week talk with your doctor about your asthma control you may need to make changes to your asthma action plan                  carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it if your child has asthma make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines including staff at the child's school they should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child                  you shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines quick-relief medicines don't reduce

controlled if                  you have symptoms no more than 2 days a week and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month                  you can do all your normal activities                  you take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week                  you have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth                  your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number                  if your asthma isn't well controlled contact your doctor he or she may need to change your asthma action plan                  use a peak flow meter                  this small hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs you blow into the device and it gives you a score or peak flow number your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test                  your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter he or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score                  your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results you may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you                  when you're first diagnosed with asthma it's important to find your personal best peak flow number to do this you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled the highest number you get during that time is your personal best you can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled                  your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack even before you notice symptoms if your score shows that your breathing is getting worse you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked                  get asthma checkups                  when you first begin treatment you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks once your asthma is controlled your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year                  during these checkups your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements he or she also may ask about your daily activities this information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control                  your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan based on your answers to these questions your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine                  if your control is very good you might be able to take less medicine the goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma                  emergency care                  most people who have asthma including many children can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans however you might need medical attention at times                  call your doctor for advice if                  your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack                  your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number                  call 9–1–1 for emergency care if                  you have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath                  you have blue lips or fingernails                  at the hospital you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home such treatment can save your life                  asthma treatment for special groups                  the treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma however some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs                  children                  it's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years thus it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines (quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not)                  doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if after assessing a child they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age (for more information go to how is asthma diagnosed)                  inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children montelukast and cromolyn are other options treatment might be given for a trial period of 1\\xa0month to 6 weeks treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly                  inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment is generally small and doesn't get worse over time poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate                  many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth                  older adults                  doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines such as beta blockers aspirin and other pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medicines these medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms                  be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including over-the-counter medicines                  older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids especially at high doses talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin d pills as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong                  pregnant women                  pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight                  studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack                  talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed                  people whose asthma symptoms occur with physical activity                  physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle adults need physical activity to maintain good health children need it for growth and development                  in some people however physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms if this happens to you or your child talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active                  the following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity                  short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them                  long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours however with daily use they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection also frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled                  leukotriene modifiers these pills are taken several hours before physical activity they can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity                  long-term control medicines frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation this will help prevent exercise-related symptoms                  easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful you also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather                  if you use your asthma medicines as your doctor directs you should be able to take part in any physical activity or sport you choose                  people having surgery                  asthma may add to the risk of having problems during and after surgery for instance having a tube put into your throat may cause an asthma attack                  tell your surgeon about your asthma when you first talk with him or her the surgeon can take steps to lower your risk such as giving you asthma medicines before or during surgery\"],\n",

       "   'ANSWER': 'how is it diagnosed  in most cases spina bifida is diagnosed prenatally or before birth  however some mild cases may go unnoticed until after birth (postnatal)  very mild forms (spinal bifida occulta) in which there are no symptoms may never be detected postnatal diagnosis  mild cases of spina bifida (occulta closed) not diagnosed during prenatal testing may be detected postnatally by plain film x-ray examination  individuals with the more severe forms of spina bifida often have muscle weakness in their feet hips and legs that result in deformities that may be present at birth  doctors may use magnetic resonance imaging (mri) or a computed tomography (ct) scan to get a clearer view of the spinal cord and vertebrae  if hydrocephalus is suspected the doctor may request a ct scan and/or x-ray of the skull to look for extra cerebrospinal fluid inside the brain',\n",

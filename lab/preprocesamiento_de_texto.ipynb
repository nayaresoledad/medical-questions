use but it seems that each treatment only addresses a narrow set of conditions for example my daughter has tried many different treatment options (qeeg heg tms topamax ) without success  has any research been done to characterize which treatment types are effective against which migraine types', 'ANSWER': 'there is no absolute cure for migraine since its pathophysiology has yet to be fully understood \\xa0there are two ways to approach the treatment of migraine headache with drugs prevent the attacks or relieve the symptoms during the attacks prevention involves the use of medications and behavioral changes \\xa0drugs originally developed for epilepsy depression or high blood pressure to prevent future attacks have been shown to be extremely effective in treating migraine botulinum toxin a has been shown to be effective in prevention of chronic migraine \\xa0behaviorally stress management strategies such as exercise relaxation techniques biofeedback mechanisms and other therapies designed to limit daily discomfort may reduce the number and severity of migraine attacks \\xa0making a log of personal triggers of migraine can also provide useful information for trigger-avoiding lifestyle changes including dietary considerations eating regularly scheduled meals with adequate hydration stopping certain medications and establishing a consistent sleep schedule hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle a weight loss program is recommended for obese individuals with migraine                  relief of

diagnosed with the disease and i am struggling to figure out what it is and how i got it my name and address is [name] [location] [contact] thank you in advance for your help', 'ANSWER': 'hypothyroidism has several causes including                  - hashimoto’s disease  - thyroiditis or inflammation of the thyroid  - congenital hypothyroidism or hypothyroidism that is present at birth  - surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid  - radiation treatment of the thyroid  - some medications                  less commonly hypothyroidism is caused by too much or too little iodine in the diet or by abnormalities of the pituitary gland                  hashimoto’s disease                  hashimoto’s disease also called chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the united states1\\xa0 hashimoto’s disease is a form of chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland\\xa0 hashimoto’s disease is also an autoimmune disorder                  normally the immune system protects the body against foreign invaders—such as viruses and bacteria—that can cause illness\\xa0 but in autoimmune diseases the immune system attacks the body’s own cells and organs\\xa0 with hashimoto’s disease the immune system attacks the thyroid causing inflammation and interfering with its ability to produce thyroid hormones                  more information is provided in the niddk health topic hashimoto’s disease                  thyroiditis                  thyroiditis causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of the thyroid gland\\xa0 at first the leakage raises hormone levels in the blood leading to hyperthyroidism—when thyroid hormone levels are too high––that lasts for 1 or 2 months\\xa0 most people then develop hypothyroidism before the thyroid is completely healed                  several types of thyroiditis can cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism                  - subacute thyroiditis this condition involves painful inflammation and enlargement of the thyroid\\xa0 experts are not sure what causes subacute thyroiditis but it may be related to a viral or bacterial infection\\xa0 the condition usually goes away on its own in a few months  - postpartum thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis develops after a woman gives birth\\xa0 for more information see the section titled “what happens with pregnancy and thyroid conditions”  - silent thyroiditis this type of thyroiditis is called “silent” because it is painless as is postpartum thyroiditis even though the thyroid may be enlarged\\xa0 like postpartum thyroiditis silent thyroiditis is probably an autoimmune condition and sometimes develops into permanent hypothyroidism                  congenital hypothyroidism                  some babies are born with a thyroid that is not fully developed or does not function properly\\xa0 if untreated congenital hypothyroidism can lead to mental retardation and growth failure\\xa0 early treatment can prevent these complications so most newborns in the united states are screened for hypothyroidism                  surgical removal of the thyroid                  when part of the thyroid is removed the remaining part may produce normal amounts of thyroid hormone but some people who have this surgery develop hypothyroidism\\xa0 removal of the entire thyroid always results in hypothyroidism                  part or all of the thyroid may be surgically removed as a treatment for                  - hyperthyroidism  - a large goiter which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to appear swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing  - thyroid nodules which are noncancerous tumors called adenomas or lumps in the thyroid that can produce excess thyroid hormone  - thyroid cancer                  radiation treatment of the thyroid                  radioactive iodine a common treatment for hyperthyroidism gradually destroys the cells of the thyroid\\xa0 most people who receive radioactive iodine treatment eventually develop hypothyroidism\\xa0 people with hodgkin’s disease other lymphomas and head or neck cancers are treated with radiation which can also damage the thyroid                  medications                  some drugs can interfere with thyroid hormone production and lead to hypothyroidism including                  - amiodarone a heart medication  - interferon alpha a cancer medication  - lithium a bipolar disorder medication  - interleukin-2 a kidney cancer medication', 'FOCUS': 'hypothyroidism', 'TYPE': 'cause'}, 'Q6': {'SUBJECT':

other vision problems including loss of sharpness (reduced acuity) severe nearsightedness (high myopia) involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus) and eyes that do not look in the same direction (strabismus) color vision is typically not affected by this disorder the vision problems associated with this condition are congenital which means they are present from birth they tend to remain stable (stationary) over time researchers have identified two major types of x-linked congenital stationary night blindness the complete form and the incomplete form the types have very similar signs and symptoms however everyone with the complete form has night blindness while not all people with the incomplete form have night blindness the types are distinguished by their genetic cause and by

caffeine tobacco and other stimulants the effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours                  certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example some cold and allergy medicines) talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep                  alcohol an alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep however alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal this makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night                  try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed for example read a book listen to soothing music or take a hot bath                  try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime                  make your bedroom sleep-friendly avoid bright lighting while winding down try to limit possible distractions such as a tv computer or pet make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable your bedroom also should be dark and quiet                  go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning even on weekends if you can avoid night shifts alternating schedules or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule                  cognitive-behavioral therapy                  cbt for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep this therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety                  for example relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety these strategies help you better control your breathing heart rate muscles and mood                  cbt also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep this method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time                  cbt also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep this method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look feel and sound the goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing                  cbt also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake this method involves setting a sleep schedule at first you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep                  this schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep however the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly over time the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep                  for success with cbt you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months cbt works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia it also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone                  for people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder cbt combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions                  medicines                  prescription medicines                  many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia some are meant for short-term use while others are meant for longer use                  talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines for example insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them                  rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating sleep walking or driving while asleep if you have side effects from an insomnia medicine or if it doesn't work well tell your doctor he or she might prescribe a different medicine                  some insomnia medicines can be habit forming ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines                  over-the-counter products                  some over-the-counter (otc) products claim to treat insomnia these products include melatonin l-tryptophan supplements and valerian teas or extracts                  the food and drug administration doesn't regulate “natural” products and some food supplements thus the dose and purity of these substances can vary how well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood                  some otc products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids although these products might make you sleepy talk to your doctor before taking them                  antihistamines pose risks for some people also these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia your doctor can advise you whether these products will

associated with other vision problems including an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia) involuntary movements of the eyes (nystagmus) and extreme farsightedness (hyperopia) the pupils which usually expand and contract in response to the amount of light entering the eye do not react normally to light instead they expand and contract more slowly than normal or they may not respond to light at all additionally the clear front covering of the eye (the cornea) may be cone-shaped and abnormally thin a condition known as keratoconus  a specific behavior called franceschetti's oculo-digital sign is characteristic of leber congenital amaurosis this sign consists of poking pressing and rubbing the eyes with a knuckle or finger researchers suspect that this behavior may contribute to

           whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood                  the test results will show whether you have hemophilia what type of hemophilia you have and how severe it is                  hemophilia a and b are classified as mild moderate or severe depending on the amount of clotting factor viii or ix in the blood                  the severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories for example some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia                  severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies thus children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life people who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults                  the bleeding problems of hemophilia a and hemophilia b are the same only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has knowing which type is important because the treatments are different                  pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies                  women who are hemophilia carriers also can have preimplantation diagnosis to have children who don't have hemophilia                  for

diastolic (di-a-stol-ik) pressures systolic refers to blood pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood diastolic refers to blood pressure when the heart is at rest between beats                  you most often will see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic number such as 120/80 mmhg (the mmhg is millimeters of mercury—the units used to measure blood pressure)                  normal blood pressure in adults is lower than 120/80 mmhg hypotension is blood pressure that's lower than 90/60 mmhg                  overview                  blood pressure doesn't stay the same all the time it lowers as you sleep and rises when you wake up blood pressure also rises when you're excited nervous or active                  your body is very sensitive to changes in blood pressure for example if you stand up quickly your blood pressure may drop for a short time your body adjusts your blood pressure to make sure enough blood and oxygen are flowing to your brain kidneys and other vital organs                  most forms of hypotension happen because your body can't bring blood pressure back to normal or can't do it fast enough                  some people have low blood pressure all the time they have no signs or symptoms and their low blood pressure is normal for them                  in other people certain conditions or factors cause abnormally low blood pressure as a result less blood and oxygen flow to the body's organs                  for the most part hypotension is a medical concern only if it causes signs or symptoms or is linked to a serious condition such as heart disease signs and symptoms of hypotension may include dizziness fainting cold and sweaty skin fatigue (tiredness) blurred vision or nausea (feeling

condition can be detected by a pap smear and is 100% treatable it can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular pap smears or they have not followed up on abnormal pap smear results  almost all cervical cancers are caused by hpv (human papillomavirus) hpv is a common virus that is spread through sexual

and put the strip into the meter the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar  your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers keep these factors in mind  - most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day  - if your blood sugar level is under control you may only need to check it a few times a week  - you may test yourself when you wake up before meals and at bedtime  - you may need to test more often when you are sick

both of them more', 'ANSWER': \"wolff-parkinson-white syndrome is a condition characterized by abnormal electrical pathways in the heart that cause a disruption of the heart's normal rhythm (arrhythmia)  the heartbeat is controlled by electrical signals that move through the heart in a highly coordinated way a specialized cluster of cells called the atrioventricular node conducts electrical impulses from the heart's upper chambers (the atria) to the lower chambers (the ventricles) impulses move through the atrioventricular node during each heartbeat stimulating the ventricles to contract slightly later than the atria  people with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome are born with an extra connection in the heart called an accessory pathway that allows electrical signals to bypass the atrioventricular node and move from the atria to the ventricles faster than usual the accessory pathway may also transmit electrical impulses abnormally from the ventricles back to the atria this extra connection can disrupt the coordinated movement of electrical signals through the heart leading to an abnormally fast heartbeat (tachycardia) and other arrhythmias resulting symptoms include dizziness a sensation of fluttering or pounding in the chest (palpitations) shortness of breath and fainting (syncope) in rare cases arrhythmias associated with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death the most common arrhythmia associated with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome is called paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia  complications of wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can occur at any age although some individuals born with an accessory pathway in the heart never experience any health problems associated with the condition  wolff-parkinson-white syndrome often occurs with other structural abnormalities of the heart or underlying heart disease the most common heart defect associated with the condition is ebstein anomaly which affects the valve that allows blood to flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle (the tricuspid valve) additionally wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can be a component of several other genetic syndromes including hypokalemic periodic paralysis (a condition that causes episodes of extreme muscle weakness) pompe disease (a disorder characterized by the storage of excess glycogen) and

'williams syndrome (ws) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by mild to moderate delays in cognitive development or learning difficulties a distinctive facial appearance and a unique personality that combines over-friendliness and high levels of empathy with anxiety the most significant medical problem associated with ws is cardiovascular disease caused by narrowed arteries ws is also associated with elevated blood calcium levels in infancy a random genetic mutation (deletion of a small piece of chromosome 7) rather than inheritance most often causes the disorder\\xa0 however individuals who have ws have a 50 percent chance of passing it on if they decide to have children\\xa0 the characteristic facial features of ws include puffiness around the eyes a short nose with a broad nasal tip wide mouth full cheeks full lips and a small chin people with ws are also likely to have a long neck sloping shoulders short stature limited mobility in their joints and curvature of the spine\\xa0 some individuals with ws have a star-like pattern in the iris of their eyes\\xa0 infants with ws are often irritable and colicky with feeding problems that keep them from gaining weight\\xa0 chronic abdominal pain is common in adolescents and adults by age 30 the majority of individuals with ws have diabetes or pre-diabetes and mild to moderate sensorineural hearing loss (a form of deafness due to disturbed function of the auditory nerve)\\xa0 for some people hearing loss may begin as early as late childhood ws also is associated with a characteristic “cognitive profile” of mental strengths and weaknesses composed of strengths in verbal short-term memory and language combined with severe weakness in visuospatial construction (the skills used to copy patterns draw or write) within language the strongest skills are typically in concrete practical vocabulary which in many cases is in the low average to average range for the general population abstract or conceptual-relational vocabulary is much more limited most older children and adults with ws speak fluently and use good grammar\\xa0 more than 50% of children with ws have attention deficit disorders (add or adhd) and about 50% have specific phobias such as a fear of loud noises the majority of individuals with ws worry excessively the national institutes of health (nih) and the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) have funded many of the research studies exploring the genetic and neurobiological origins of ws\\xa0 in the early 1990s researchers located and identified the genetic mutation responsible for the disorder the deletion of a small section of chromosome 7 that contains approximately 25 genes\\xa0 ninds continues to support ws researchers including for example groups that are attempting to link specific genes with the corresponding facial cognitive personality and neurological characteristics of ws', 'FOCUS': 'williams syndrome', 'TYPE':

may consider tapering celexa in the third trimester maintenance treatment  it is generally agreed that acute episodes of depression require several months or longer of sustained pharmacologic therapy systematic evaluation of celexa in two studies has shown that its antidepressant efficacy is maintained for periods of up to 24 weeks following 6 or 8 weeks of initial treatment (32 weeks total) in one study patients were assigned randomly to placebo or to the same dose of celexa (20-60 mg/day) during maintenance treatment as they had received during the acute stabilization phase while in the other study patients were assigned randomly to continuation of celexa 20 or 40 mg/day or placebo for maintenance treatment in the latter study the rates of relapse to depression were similar for the

for 1 - 7 days depending on which medicine you buy (if you do not get repeated infections a 1-day medicine might work for you)  - do not stop using these medicines early because your symptoms are better    you doctor can also prescribe a pill that you only take by mouth once  if your symptoms are worse or you get vaginal yeast infections often you may need  - medicine for up to 14 days  - clotrimazole vaginal suppository or fluconazole pill every week to prevent new infections    to help prevent and treat vaginal discharge  - keep your genital area clean and dry avoid soap and rinse with water only sitting in a warm but not hot bath may help your symptoms  - avoid douching although many women feel cleaner if they douche after their period or intercourse it may worsen vaginal discharge douching removes healthy bacteria lining the vagina that protect against infection  - eat yogurt with live cultures or take lactobacillus acidophilus tablets when you are on antibiotics this will help to prevent a yeast infection  - use condoms to avoid catching or spreading infections  - avoid using feminine hygiene sprays fragrances or powders in the genital area  - avoid wearing tight-fitting pants or shorts which may cause irritation  - wear cotton underwear or cotton-crotch pantyhose avoid underwear made of silk or nylon because they can increase sweating in the genital

causes asthma is the hygiene hypothesis they believe that our western lifestyle—with its emphasis on hygiene and sanitation—has resulted in changes in our living conditions and an overall decline in infections in early childhood                  many young children no longer have the same types of environmental exposures and infections as children did in the past this affects the way that young

abnormality occurs as a random event during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and sperm) in the affected person's parent an error in cell division called nondisjunction can result in reproductive cells with an abnormal number of chromosomes for example an egg or sperm cell may lose a sex chromosome as a result of nondisjunction if one of these atypical reproductive cells contributes to the genetic makeup of a child the child will have a single x chromosome in each cell and will be missing the other sex chromosome  mosaic turner syndrome is also not inherited in an affected individual it occurs as a random event during cell division in early fetal development as a result some of an affected person's cells have the usual two sex chromosomes and other cells have

of gene therapy to treat salivary gland dysfunction the idea is to transfer additional or replacement genes into the salivary glands of people with sjögren's syndrome and cancer patients whose

in salivary glands and that it has the potential to help head and neck cancer survivors with dry mouth read nidcr’s news release  to learn more about the study’s findings based on the promising results of this trial similar clinical trials are planned in the near future research on sjögren’s syndrome and other diseases affecting salivary glands nidcr is also conducting clinical trials to study new approaches for improving salivary flow in patients with sjogren’s syndrome such studies include testing the effectiveness of a monoclonal antibody as well as a corticosteroid to see whether either of these treatments helps improve salivary flow other studies are focused on learning how diseases such as diabetes auto inflammatory diseases and granulomatous diseases cause salivary gland

reflux a condition in which urine backs up into the ducts that normally carry it from each kidney to the bladder (the ureters) urine may also accumulate in the kidneys (hydronephrosis) vesicoureteral reflux and hydronephrosis can lead to frequent infections of the urinary tract and kidney inflammation (pyelonephritis) causing damage that may eventually result in kidney failure  individuals with

young children                  most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age however asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose                  sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition this is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions                  also many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old                  a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections the airways grow as the child grows older so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds                  a young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if                  one or both parents have asthma                  the child has signs of allergies including the

other infection                  the most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test a medical history and a physical exam however it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years thus doctors must rely on children's medical histories signs and symptoms and physical exams to make a diagnosis                  doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma

chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur                  inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed these medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming even if you take them every day for many years                  like many other medicines though inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects                  one common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush you might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush these devices attach to your inhaler they help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat                  check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have also work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush                  if you have severe asthma you may have to take

short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief                  these medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup this allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them                  you should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms if you use this medicine more than 2 days a week talk with your doctor about your asthma control you may need to make changes to your asthma action plan                  carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it if your child has asthma make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines including staff at the child's school they should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child                  you shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation                  track your asthma                  to track your asthma keep records of your symptoms check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter and get regular asthma checkups

        you have symptoms no more than 2 days a week and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month                  you can do all your normal activities                  you take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week                  you have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth                  your

            use a peak flow meter                  this small hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs you blow into the device and it gives you a score or peak flow number your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test                  your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter he or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score                  your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results you may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you                  when you're first diagnosed with asthma it's important to find your personal best peak flow number to do this you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled the highest number you get during that time is your personal best you can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled                  your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack even before you notice symptoms if your score shows that your breathing is getting worse you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked                  get asthma checkups                  when you first begin treatment you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks once your asthma is controlled your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year                  during these checkups your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements he or she also may ask about your daily activities this information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control                  your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan based on your answers to these questions your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine                  if your control is very good you might be able to take less medicine the goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma                  emergency care                  most people who have asthma including many children can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans however you might need medical attention at times                  call your doctor for advice if                  your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack                  your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number                  call 9–1–1 for emergency care if                  you have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath                  you have blue lips or fingernails                  at

treatment for special groups                  the treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma however some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs                  children                  it's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years thus it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines (quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not)                  doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if after assessing a child they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age (for more information go to how is asthma diagnosed)                  inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children montelukast and cromolyn are other options treatment might be given for a trial period of 1\\xa0month to 6 weeks treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly                  inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment is generally small and doesn't get worse over time poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate                  many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth                  older adults                  doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines such as beta blockers aspirin and other pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medicines these medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms                  be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including over-the-counter medicines                  older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids especially at high doses talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin d pills as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong                  pregnant women                  pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight                  studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack                  talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed                  people whose asthma symptoms occur with physical activity                  physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle adults need physical activity to maintain good health children need it for growth and development                  in some people however physical activity can trigger asthma symptoms if this happens to you or your child talk with your doctor about the best ways to control asthma so you can stay active                  the following medicines may help prevent asthma symptoms caused by physical activity                  short-acting beta2-agonists (quick-relief medicine) taken shortly before physical activity can last 2 to 3 hours and prevent exercise-related symptoms in most people who take them                  long-acting beta2-agonists can be protective for up to 12 hours however with daily use they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection also frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is poorly controlled                  leukotriene modifiers these pills are taken several hours before physical activity they can help relieve asthma symptoms brought on by physical activity                  long-term control medicines frequent or severe symptoms due to physical activity may suggest poorly controlled asthma and the need to either start or increase long-term control medicines that reduce inflammation this will help prevent exercise-related symptoms                  easing into physical activity with a warmup period may be helpful you also may want to wear a mask or scarf over your mouth when exercising in cold weather

occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot this may happen in two ways   - a clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow this is called a thrombotic stroke  - a clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain or from some other part of the body and travel up to the brain this is called cerebral embolism or an embolic stroke    ischemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries       watch this video about   stroke         watch this video about   stroke - secondary to cardiogenic embolism     a hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open this causes blood to leak into the brain some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely these defects may include   - aneurysm  - arteriovenous malformation (avm)    hemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners such as warfarin (coumadin) very high blood pressure may cause blood vessels to burst leading to hemorrhagic stroke   an ischemic stroke can develop bleeding and become a hemorrhagic stroke  high blood pressure is the main risk factor for strokes other major risk factors are  - irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation  - diabetes  - family history of stroke  - high cholesterol  - increasing age especially after age 55  - ethnicity (african americans are more likely to die of a stroke)        watch this video about   hypertension - overview     stroke risk

the breastbone to the top of the pubic bone the surgeon then clamps off the aorta cuts open the aneurysm and sews in a graft to act as a bridge for the blood flow the blood flow then goes through the plastic graft and no longer allows the direct pulsation pressure of the blood to further expand the weak aorta wall  interventional repair - this minimally invasive technique is performed by an interventional radiologist using imaging to guide the catheter and graft inside the patient's artery for the procedure an incision is made in the skin at the groin through which a catheter is passed

be treated with medication as well orthopedic problems such as foot deformities and scoliosis can be corrected with braces or surgery physical therapy may prolong use of the arms and legs advances in understanding the genetics of friedreich's ataxia are leading to breakthroughs in treatment research has moved forward to the point where clinical trials of proposed treatments are presently occurring for friedreich’s ataxia  what research is being done   within the federal government the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds) a component of the national institutes of health (nih) has primary responsibility for sponsoring research on neurological disorders as part of this mission the ninds conducts research on friedreich's ataxia and other forms of inherited ataxias at its facilities at the nih and supports additional studies at medical centers throughout the united states several nonprofit organizations also provide substantial support research (see the section on where can i get more information)   researchers are optimistic that they have begun to understand the causes of the disease and work has begun to develop effective treatments and prevention strategies for friedreich's ataxia scientists have been able to create various models of the disease in yeast and mice which have facilitated understanding the cause of the disease and are now being used for drug discovery and the development of novel treatments   studies have revealed that frataxin is an important mitochondrial protein for proper function of several organs yet in people with the disease the amount of frataxin in affected cells is severely reduced it is believed that the loss of frataxin makes the nervous system heart and pancreas particularly susceptible to damage from free radicals (produced when the excess iron reacts with oxygen) once certain cells in these tissues are destroyed by free radicals they cannot be replaced nerve and muscle cells also have metabolic needs that may make them particularly vulnerable to this damage free radicals have been implicated in other degenerative diseases such as parkinson's and alzheimer's diseases   based upon this information scientists and physicians have tried to reduce the levels of free radicals also called oxidants using treatment with “antioxidants” initial clinical studies in europe suggested that antioxidants like coenzyme q10 vitamin e and idebenone may offer individuals some limited benefit however recent clinical trials in the united states and europe have not revealed effectiveness of idebenone in people with friedreich’s ataxia but more powerful modified forms of this agent and other antioxidants are in trials at this time there is also a clinical trial to examine the efficacy of selectively removing excess iron from the mitochondria   scientists also are exploring ways to increase frataxin levels through drug treatments genetic engineering and protein delivery systems several compounds that are directed at increasing levels of frataxin may be brought to clinical trials in the near future to check for current trials visit http//wwwclinicaltrialsgov additional information is available from the groups listed in the following section   armed with what they currently know about frataxin and friedreich’s ataxia scientists are working to better define fraxatin’s role clarify how defects in iron

the progression of rp research suggests taking high doses of vitamin a (15000 iu/day) may slow progression a little in some people but the results are not strong taking too much vitamin a can be toxic and the effects of vitamin a on the disease is relatively weak more research must be conducted before this is a widely accepted form of therapy  research is also being conducted in areas such as gene therapy research transplant research and retinal prosthesis since rp is usually the result of a defective gene gene therapy has become a widely explored area for future research the goal of such research would be to discover ways healthy genes can be inserted into the retina attempts at transplanting healthy retinal cells into sick retinas are being made experimentally and have not yet been considered as clinically safe and successful retinal prosthesis is also an important area of exploration because the prosthesis a man-made device intended to replace a damaged body part can be designed to take over the function of the lost photoreceptors by electrically stimulating the remaining healthy cells of the retinathrough electrical stimulation the activated ganglion cells can provide a visual signal to the brain the visual scene captured by a camera is transmitted via electromagnetic radiation to a small decoder chip located on the retinal surface data and power are then sent to a set of electrodes connected to the decoder electrical current passing from individual electrodes stimulate cells in the appropriate areas of the retina corresponding to the features in the visual scene', 'FOCUS': 'retinitis pigmentosa', 'TYPE': 'Treatment'}, 'Q269': {'SUBJECT': 'Physician', 'MESSAGE': 'i am looking for a type of physician that specializes in treating leg cramps in the

after an evaluation and before beginning hormonal therapy you and your gynecology (gyn) team may decide to keep track of your symptoms and try mild pain medicine this is usually the first step for girls with premenarcheal endometriosis (who are too young to have had their first period)  medical suppression hormonal treatment such as birth control pills containing estrogen and progesterone taken continuously (to stop periods) relieves symptoms in many patients a second treatment is progesterone medicine alone this comes as a progestin–only birth control pill in a pill pack (nor–qd® or camilla®) or as a regular pill that comes in a bottle norethindrone acetate (aygestin®)  the dose of aygestin® can be adjusted for your body to stop your pain and bleeding another type of medication is a gnrh agonist such as leuprolide acetate (lupron–depot®) this medicine works by shutting off hormones made by the ovaries and temporarily stops your period the use of gnrh agonist therapy lowers your body’s estrogen level (one of the hormones that causes your body to have periods)  surgery visible endometriosis will be destroyed at the time of laparoscopy after this procedure many teens find relief from symptoms most say that their pain is better but not completely gone remember there is no cure for endometriosis many teens may experience pain again  lifestyle changes dealing with chronic pelvic pain can be challenging exercising often helps to relieve or lessen pelvic pain and menstrual cramps eating a balanced diet and getting enough rest also helps your body manage pain practicing relaxation techniques such as yoga and meditation help to ease pain too  pain treatment services if you do not have relief from your symptoms your gynecologist may refer you to a pain treatment

relationships with other people or in their social and emotional responsiveness thus allowing us to exclude a genuine comorbidity with a picture of autism indeed the risk facing the visually impaired

congestive heart failure can prevent this the opposite is also true treatment of chronic kidney disease can prevent congestive heart failure there is new evidence showing the cardioprotective effect

not as good so it is important to explore all available options before having additional surgery  doctors consider revision surgery for two reasons if medication and lifestyle changes do not relieve pain and disability or if x rays of the hip show damage to the bone around the artificial hip that must be corrected before it is too late for a successful revision this surgery is usually considered

       "   'ANSWER': \"lifestyle changes often can help relieve acute (short-term) insomnia these changes might make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep                  a type of counseling called cognitive-behavioral therapy (cbt) can help relieve the anxiety linked to chronic (ongoing) insomnia anxiety tends to prolong insomnia                  several medicines also can help relieve insomnia and re-establish a regular sleep schedule however if your insomnia is the symptom or side effect of another problem it's important to treat the underlying cause (if possible)                  lifestyle changes                  if you have insomnia avoid substances that make it worse such as                  caffeine tobacco and other stimulants the effects of these substances can last as long as 8 hours                  certain over-the-counter and prescription medicines that can disrupt sleep (for example some cold and allergy medicines) talk with your doctor about which medicines won't disrupt your sleep                  alcohol an alcoholic drink before bedtime might make it easier for you to fall asleep however alcohol triggers sleep that tends to be lighter than normal this makes it more likely that you will wake up during the night                  try to adopt bedtime habits that make it easier to fall asleep and stay asleep follow a routine that helps you wind down and relax before bed for example read a book listen to soothing music or take a hot bath                  try to schedule your daily exercise at least 5 to 6 hours before going to bed don't eat heavy meals or drink a lot before bedtime                  make your bedroom sleep-friendly avoid bright lighting while winding down try to limit possible distractions such as a tv computer or pet make sure the temperature of your bedroom is cool and comfortable your bedroom also should be dark and quiet                  go to sleep around the same time each night and wake up around the same time each morning even on weekends if you can avoid night shifts alternating schedules or other things that may disrupt your sleep schedule                  cognitive-behavioral therapy                  cbt for insomnia targets the thoughts and actions that can disrupt sleep this therapy encourages good sleep habits and uses several methods to relieve sleep anxiety                  for example relaxation techniques and biofeedback are used to reduce anxiety these strategies help you better control your breathing heart rate muscles and mood                  cbt also aims to replace sleep anxiety with more positive thinking that links being in bed with being asleep this method also teaches you what to do if you're unable to fall asleep within a reasonable time                  cbt also may involve talking with a therapist one-on-one or in group sessions to help you consider your thoughts and feelings about sleep this method may encourage you to describe thoughts racing through your mind in terms of how they look feel and sound the goal is for your mind to settle down and stop racing                  cbt also focuses on limiting the time you spend in bed while awake this method involves setting a sleep schedule at first you will limit your total time in bed to the typical short length of time you're usually asleep                  this schedule might make you even more tired because some of the allotted time in bed will be taken up by problems falling asleep however the resulting tiredness is intended to help you get to sleep more quickly over time the length of time spent in bed is increased until you get a full night of sleep                  for success with cbt you may need to see a therapist who is skilled in this approach weekly over 2 to 3 months cbt works as well as prescription medicine for many people who have chronic insomnia it also may provide better long-term relief than medicine alone                  for people who have insomnia and major depressive disorder cbt combined with antidepression medicines has shown promise in relieving both conditions                  medicines                  prescription medicines                  many prescription medicines are used to treat insomnia some are meant for short-term use while others are meant for longer use                  talk to your doctor about the benefits and side effects of insomnia medicines for example insomnia medicines can help you fall asleep but you may feel groggy in the morning after taking them                  rare side effects of these medicines include sleep eating sleep walking or driving while asleep if you have side effects from an insomnia medicine or if it doesn't work well tell your doctor he or she might prescribe a different medicine                  some insomnia medicines can be habit forming ask your doctor about the benefits and risks of insomnia medicines                  over-the-counter products                  some over-the-counter (otc) products claim to treat insomnia these products include melatonin l-tryptophan supplements and valerian teas or extracts                  the food and drug administration doesn't regulate “natural” products and some food supplements thus the dose and purity of these substances can vary how well these products work and how safe they are isn't well understood                  some otc products that contain antihistamines are sold as sleep aids although these products might make you sleepy talk to your doctor before taking them                  antihistamines pose risks for some people also these products may not offer the best treatment for your insomnia your doctor can advise you whether these products will benefit you\",\n",

       "   'ANSWER': \"if you or your child appears to have a bleeding problem your doctor will ask about your personal and family medical histories this will reveal whether you or your family members including women and girls have bleeding problems however some people who have hemophilia have no recent family history of the disease                  you or your child also will likely have a physical exam and blood tests to diagnose hemophilia blood tests are used to find out                  how long it takes for your blood to clot                  whether your blood has low levels of any clotting factors                  whether any clotting factors are completely missing from your blood                  the test results will show whether you have hemophilia what type of hemophilia you have and how severe it is                  hemophilia a and b are classified as mild moderate or severe depending on the amount of clotting factor viii or ix in the blood                  the severity of symptoms can overlap between the categories for example some people who have mild hemophilia may have bleeding problems almost as often or as severe as some people who have moderate hemophilia                  severe hemophilia can cause serious bleeding problems in babies thus children who have severe hemophilia usually are diagnosed during the first year of life people who have milder forms of hemophilia may not be diagnosed until they're adults                  the bleeding problems of hemophilia a and hemophilia b are the same only special blood tests can tell which type of the disorder you or your child has knowing which type is important because the treatments are different                  pregnant women who are known hemophilia carriers can have the disorder diagnosed in their unborn babies as early as 12 weeks into their pregnancies                  women who are hemophilia carriers also can have preimplantation diagnosis to have children who don't have hemophilia                  for this process women have their eggs removed and fertilized by sperm in a laboratory the embryos are then tested for hemophilia only embryos without the disorder are implanted in the womb\",\n",

       "   'ANSWER': 'treatment depends on many things  - the cause of scoliosis  - where the curve is in your spine  - how big the curve is  - if your body is still growing   most people with idiopathic scoliosis do not need treatment but you should still be checked by a doctor about every 6 months   if you are still growing your doctor might recommend a back brace a back brace prevents further curving there are many different types of braces what kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it back braces can be adjusted as you grow  back braces work best in people over age 10 braces do not work for those with congenital or neuromuscular scoliosis   you may need surgery if the spine curve is severe or getting worse very quickly  surgery involves correcting the curve as much as possible  - surgery is done with a cut through the back belly area or beneath the ribs  - the spine bones are held in place with 1 or 2 metal rods the rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together  - after surgery you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine still   scoliosis treatment may also include  - emotional support some children especially teens may be self-conscious when using a back brace  - physical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly',\n",

       "   'ANSWER': \"the goal of treatment at first is to lower your high blood glucose levels long-term goals are to prevent problems from diabetes  the most important way to treat and manage type 2 diabetes is with activity and healthy eating  everyone with diabetes should receive proper education and support about the best ways to manage their diabetes ask your healthcare provider about seeing a diabetes educator   learn these skills  learning diabetes management skills will help you live well with diabetes these skills help prevent health problems and the need for medical care skills include  - how to test and record your blood glucose  - what and when to eat  - how to safely increase your activity and control your weight  - how to take medications if needed  - how to recognize and treat low and high blood sugar  - how to handle sick days  - where to buy diabetes supplies and how to store them    it may take several months to learn these skills keep learning about diabetes its complications and how to control and live well\\xa0with the disease stay up-to-date on new research and treatments  managing your blood sugar  checking your blood sugar levels yourself and writing down the results tells you how well you are managing your diabetes talk to your doctor and diabetes educator about how often to check  to check your blood sugar level you use a device called a glucose meter usually you prick your finger with a small needle called a lancet this gives you a tiny drop of blood you place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter the meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar  your doctor or diabetes educator will help set up a testing schedule for you your doctor will help you set a target range for your blood sugar numbers keep these factors in mind  - most people with type 2 diabetes only need to check their blood sugar once or twice a day  - if your blood sugar level is under control you may only need to check it a few times a week  - you may test yourself when you wake up before meals and at bedtime  - you may need to test more often when you are sick or under stress    keep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your doctor based on your numbers you may need to make changes to your meals activity or medicines to keep your blood sugar level in the right range   healthy eating and weight control  work closely with your doctor nurse and dietitian to learn how much fat protein and carbohydrates you need in your diet your meal plans should fit your lifestyle and habits and should include foods that you like  managing your weight and having a well-balanced diet are important some people with type 2 diabetes can stop taking medicines after losing weight this does not mean that their diabetes is cured they still have diabetes  very obese patients whose diabetes is not well managed with diet and medicine may consider weight loss (bariatric) surgery  regular physical activity  regular activity is important for everyone it is even more important when you have diabetes exercise is good for your health because it  - lowers your blood sugar level without medicine  - burns extra calories and fat to help manage your weight  - improves blood flow and blood pressure  - increases your energy level  - improves your ability to handle stress    talk to your doctor before starting any exercise program people with type 2 diabetes may need to take special steps before during and after physical activity or exercise   medications to treat diabetes  if diet and exercise do not help keep your blood sugar at normal or near-normal levels your doctor may prescribe medication since these drugs help lower your blood sugar levels in different ways your doctor may have you take more than one drug  some of the most common types of medication are listed below they are taken by mouth or injection  - alpha-glucosidase inhibitors  - biguanides  - dpp iv inhibitors  - injectable medicines (glp-1 analogs)  - meglitinides  - sgl t2 inhibitors  - sulfonylureas  - thiazolidinediones    you may need to take insulin if your blood sugar cannot be controlled with any of the above medicines insulin must be injected under the skin using a syringe insulin pen or pump it cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin  preventing complications  your doctor may prescribe medicines or other treatments to reduce your chance of developing some of the more common complications of diabetes including   - eye disease  - kidney disease  - heart disease and stroke   foot care  people with diabetes are more likely than those without diabetes to have foot problems diabetes damages the nerves this can make you less able to feel pressure on the foot you many not notice a foot injury until you get a severe infection  diabetes can also damage blood vessels small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (ulcers) the affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal or become larger deeper or infected  to prevent problems with your feet  - stop smoking if you smoke  - improve control of your blood sugar  - get a foot exam by your doctor at least twice a year and learn if you have nerve damage  - check and care for your feet every day this is very important when you already have nerve or blood vessel damage or foot problems  - treat minor infections such as athlete's foot right away  - use moisturizing lotion on dry skin  - make sure you wear the right kind of shoes ask your doctor what type of shoe is right for you\",\n",

       "   'ANSWER': \"frozen shoulder also known as adhesive capsulitis is a condition characterized by stiffness and pain in your shoulder joint signs and symptoms typically begin gradually worsen over time and then resolve usually within one to three years  your risk of developing frozen shoulder increases if you're recovering from a medical condition or procedure that prevents you from moving your arm — such as a stroke or a mastectomy  treatment for frozen shoulder involves range-of-motion exercises and sometimes corticosteroids and numbing medications injected into the joint capsule in a small percentage of cases arthroscopic surgery may be indicated to loosen the joint capsule so that it can move more freely  it's unusual for frozen shoulder to recur in the same shoulder but some people can develop it in the opposite shoulder\",\n",

       "   'ANSWER': \"your primary care doctor will diagnose asthma based on your medical and family histories a physical exam and test results                  your doctor also will figure out the severity of your asthma—that is whether it's intermittent mild moderate or severe the level of severity will determine what treatment you'll start on                  you may need to see an asthma specialist if                  you need special tests to help diagnose asthma                  you've had a life-threatening asthma attack                  you need more than one kind of medicine or higher doses of medicine to control your asthma or if you have overall problems getting your asthma well controlled                  you're thinking about getting allergy treatments                  medical and family histories                  your doctor may ask about your family history of asthma and allergies he or she also may ask whether you have asthma symptoms and when and how often they occur                  let your doctor know whether your symptoms seem to happen only during certain times of the year or in certain places or if they get worse at night                  your doctor also may want to know what factors seem to trigger your symptoms or worsen them for more information about possible asthma triggers go to what are the signs and symptoms of asthma                  your doctor may ask you about related health conditions that can interfere with asthma management these conditions include a runny nose sinus infections reflux disease psychological stress and sleep apnea                  physical exam                  your doctor will listen to your breathing and look for signs of asthma or allergies these signs include wheezing a runny nose or swollen nasal passages and allergic skin conditions (such as eczema)                  keep in mind that you can still have asthma even if you don't have these signs on the day that your doctor examines you                  diagnostic tests                  lung function test                  your doctor will use a test called spirometry (spi-rom-eh-tre) to check how your lungs are working this test measures how much air you can breathe in and out it also measures how fast you can blow air out                  your doctor also may give you medicine and then test you again to see whether the results have improved                  if the starting results are lower than normal and improve with the medicine and if your medical history shows a pattern of asthma symptoms your diagnosis will likely be asthma                  other tests                  your doctor may recommend other tests if he or she needs more information to make a diagnosis other tests may include                  allergy testing to find out which allergens affect you if any                  a test to measure how sensitive your airways are this is called a bronchoprovocation (brong-ko-prav-eh-ka-shun) test using spirometry this test repeatedly measures your lung function during physical activity or after you receive increasing doses of cold air or a special chemical to breathe in                  a test to show whether you have another condition with the same symptoms as asthma such as reflux disease vocal cord dysfunction or sleep apnea                  a chest x ray or an ekg (electrocardiogram) these tests will help find out whether a foreign object or other disease may be causing your symptoms                  diagnosing asthma in young children                  most children who have asthma develop their first symptoms before 5 years of age however asthma in young children (aged 0 to 5 years) can be hard to diagnose                  sometimes it's hard to tell whether a child has asthma or another childhood condition this is because the symptoms of asthma also occur with other conditions                  also many young children who wheeze when they get colds or respiratory infections don't go on to have asthma after they're 6 years old                  a child may wheeze because he or she has small airways that become even narrower during colds or respiratory infections the airways grow as the child grows older so wheezing no longer occurs when the child gets colds                  a young child who has frequent wheezing with colds or respiratory infections is more likely to have asthma if                  one or both parents have asthma                  the child has signs of allergies including the allergic skin condition eczema                  the child has allergic reactions to pollens or other airborne allergens                  the child wheezes even when he or she doesn't have a cold or other infection                  the most certain way to diagnose asthma is with a lung function test a medical history and a physical exam however it's hard to do lung function tests in children younger than 5 years thus doctors must rely on children's medical histories signs and symptoms and physical exams to make a diagnosis                  doctors also may use a 4–6 week trial of asthma medicines to see how well a child responds\",\n",

 taking an active role to control your asthma involves                  working with your doctor to treat other conditions that can interfere with asthma management                  avoiding things that worsen your asthma (asthma triggers) however one trigger you should not avoid is physical activity physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active                  working with your doctor and other health care providers to create and follow an asthma action plan                  an asthma action plan gives guidance on taking your medicines properly avoiding asthma triggers (except physical activity) tracking your level of asthma control responding to worsening symptoms and seeking emergency care when needed                  asthma is treated with two types of medicines long-term control and quick-relief medicines long-term control medicines help reduce airway inflammation and prevent asthma symptoms quick-relief or rescue medicines relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up                  your initial treatment will depend on the severity of your asthma followup asthma treatment will depend on how well your asthma action plan is controlling your symptoms and preventing asthma attacks                  your level of asthma control can vary over time and with changes in your home school or work environments these changes can alter how often you're exposed to the factors that can worsen your asthma                  your doctor may need to increase your medicine if your asthma doesn't stay under control on the other hand if your asthma is well controlled for several months your doctor may decrease your medicine these adjustments to your medicine will help you maintain the best control possible with the least amount of medicine necessary                  asthma treatment for certain groups of people—such as children pregnant women or those for whom exercise brings on asthma symptoms—will be adjusted to meet their special needs                  follow an asthma action plan                  you can work with your doctor to create a personal asthma action plan the plan will describe your daily treatments such as which medicines to take and when to take them the plan also will explain when to call your doctor or go to the emergency room                  if your child has asthma all of the people who care for him or her should know about the child's asthma action plan this includes babysitters and workers at daycare centers schools and camps these caretakers can help your child follow his or her action plan                  go to the national heart lung and blood institute's (nhlbi's) asthma action plan for a sample plan                  avoid things that can worsen your asthma                  many common things (called asthma triggers) can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms once you know what these things are you can take steps to control many of them (for more information about asthma triggers go to what are the signs and symptoms of asthma)                  for example exposure to pollens or air pollution might make your asthma worse if so try to limit time outdoors when the levels of these substances in the outdoor air are high if animal fur triggers your asthma symptoms keep pets with fur out of your home or bedroom                  one possible asthma trigger you shouldn’t avoid is physical activity physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle talk with your doctor about medicines that can help you stay active                  the nhlbi offers many useful tips for controlling asthma triggers for more information go to page 2 of nhlbi's asthma action plan                  if your asthma symptoms are clearly related to allergens and you can't avoid exposure to those allergens your doctor may advise you to get allergy shots                  you may need to see a specialist if you're thinking about getting allergy shots these shots can lessen or prevent your asthma symptoms but they can't cure your asthma                  several health conditions can make asthma harder to manage these conditions include runny nose sinus infections reflux disease psychological stress and sleep apnea your doctor will treat these conditions as well                  medicines                  your doctor will consider many things when deciding which asthma medicines are best for you he or she will check to see how well a medicine works for you then he or she will adjust the dose or medicine as needed                  asthma medicines can be taken in pill form but most are taken using a device called an inhaler an inhaler allows the medicine to go directly to your lungs                  not all inhalers are used the same way ask your doctor or another health care provider to show you the right way to use your inhaler review the way you use your inhaler at every medical visit                  long-term control medicines                  most people who have asthma need to take long-term control medicines daily to help prevent symptoms the most effective long-term medicines reduce airway inflammation which helps prevent symptoms from starting these medicines don't give you quick relief from symptoms                  inhaled corticosteroids inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred medicine for long-term control of asthma they're the most effective option for long-term relief of the inflammation and swelling that makes your airways sensitive to certain inhaled substances                  reducing inflammation helps prevent the chain reaction that causes asthma symptoms most people who take these medicines daily find they greatly reduce the severity of symptoms and how often they occur                  inhaled corticosteroids generally are safe when taken as prescribed these medicines are different from the illegal anabolic steroids taken by some athletes inhaled corticosteroids aren't habit-forming even if you take them every day for many years                  like many other medicines though inhaled corticosteroids can have side effects most doctors agree that the benefits of taking inhaled corticosteroids and preventing asthma attacks far outweigh the risk of side effects                  one common side effect from inhaled corticosteroids is a mouth infection called thrush you might be able to use a spacer or holding chamber on your inhaler to avoid thrush these devices attach to your inhaler they help prevent the medicine from landing in your mouth or on the back of your throat                  check with your doctor to see whether a spacer or holding chamber should be used with the inhaler you have also work with your health care team if you have any questions about how to use a spacer or holding chamber rinsing your mouth out with water after taking inhaled corticosteroids also can lower your risk for thrush                  if you have severe asthma you may have to take corticosteroid pills or liquid for short periods to get your asthma under control                  if taken for long periods these medicines raise your risk for cataracts and osteoporosis (os-te-o-po-ro-sis) a cataract is the clouding of the lens in your eye osteoporosis is a disorder that makes your bones weak and more likely to break                  your doctor may have you add another long-term asthma control medicine so he or she can lower your dose of corticosteroids or your doctor may suggest you take calcium and vitamin d pills to protect your bones                  other long-term control medicines other long-term control medicines include                  cromolyn this medicine is taken using a device called a nebulizer as you breathe in the nebulizer sends a fine mist of medicine to your lungs cromolyn helps prevent airway inflammation                  omalizumab (anti-ige) this medicine is given as a shot (injection) one or two times a month it helps prevent your body from reacting to asthma triggers such as pollen and dust mites anti-ige might be used if other asthma medicines have not worked well                  \\xa0a rare but possibly life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis might occur when the omalizumab injection is given if you take this medication work with your doctor to make sure you understand the signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis and what actions you \\xa0should take                  inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists these medicines open the airways they might be added to inhaled corticosteroids to improve asthma control inhaled long-acting beta2-agonists should never be used on their own for long-term asthma control they must used with inhaled corticosteroids                  leukotriene modifiers these medicines are taken by mouth they help block the chain reaction that increases inflammation in your airways                  theophylline this medicine is taken by mouth theophylline helps open the airways                  if your doctor prescribes a long-term control medicine take it every day to control your asthma your asthma symptoms will likely return or get worse if you stop taking your medicine                  long-term control medicines can have side effects talk with your doctor about these side effects and ways to reduce or avoid them                  with some medicines like theophylline your doctor will check the level of medicine in your blood this helps ensure that you’re getting enough medicine to relieve your asthma symptoms but not so much that it causes dangerous side effects                  quick-relief medicines                  all people who have asthma need quick-relief medicines to help relieve asthma symptoms that may flare up inhaled short-acting beta2-agonists are the first choice for quick relief                  these medicines act quickly to relax tight muscles around your airways when you're having a flareup this allows the airways to open up so air can flow through them                  you should take your quick-relief medicine when you first notice asthma symptoms if you use this medicine more than 2 days a week talk with your doctor about your asthma control you may need to make changes to your asthma action plan                  carry your quick-relief inhaler with you at all times in case you need it if your child has asthma make sure that anyone caring for him or her has the child's quick-relief medicines including staff at the child's school they should understand when and how to use these medicines and when to seek medical care for your child                  you shouldn't use quick-relief medicines in place of prescribed long-term control medicines quick-relief medicines don't reduce inflammation                  track your asthma                  to track your asthma keep records of your symptoms check your peak flow number using a peak flow meter and get regular asthma checkups                  record your symptoms                  you can record your asthma symptoms in a diary to see how well your treatments are controlling your asthma                  asthma is well controlled if                  you have symptoms no more than 2 days a week and these symptoms don't wake you from sleep more than 1 or 2 nights a month                  you can do all your normal activities                  you take quick-relief medicines no more than 2 days a week                  you have no more than one asthma attack a year that requires you to take corticosteroids by mouth                  your peak flow doesn't drop below 80 percent of your personal best number                  if your asthma isn't well controlled contact your doctor he or she may need to change your asthma action plan                  use a peak flow meter                  this small hand-held device shows how well air moves out of your lungs you blow into the device and it gives you a score or peak flow number your score shows how well your lungs are working at the time of the test                  your doctor will tell you how and when to use your peak flow meter he or she also will teach you how to take your medicines based on your score                  your doctor and other health care providers may ask you to use your peak flow meter each morning and keep a record of your results you may find it very useful to record peak flow scores for a couple of weeks before each medical visit and take the results with you                  when you're first diagnosed with asthma it's important to find your personal best peak flow number to do this you record your score each day for a 2- to 3-week period when your asthma is well-controlled the highest number you get during that time is your personal best you can compare this number to future numbers to make sure your asthma is controlled                  your peak flow meter can help warn you of an asthma attack even before you notice symptoms if your score shows that your breathing is getting worse you should take your quick-relief medicines the way your asthma action plan directs then you can use the peak flow meter to check how well the medicine worked                  get asthma checkups                  when you first begin treatment you'll see your doctor about every 2 to 6 weeks once your asthma is controlled your doctor may want to see you from once a month to twice a year                  during these checkups your doctor may ask whether you've had an asthma attack since the last visit or any changes in symptoms or peak flow measurements he or she also may ask about your daily activities this information will help your doctor assess your level of asthma control                  your doctor also may ask whether you have any problems or concerns with taking your medicines or following your asthma action plan based on your answers to these questions your doctor may change the dose of your medicine or give you a new medicine                  if your control is very good you might be able to take less medicine the goal is to use the least amount of medicine needed to control your asthma                  emergency care                  most people who have asthma including many children can safely manage their symptoms by following their asthma action plans however you might need medical attention at times                  call your doctor for advice if                  your medicines don't relieve an asthma attack                  your peak flow is less than half of your personal best peak flow number                  call 9–1–1 for emergency care if                  you have trouble walking and talking because you're out of breath                  you have blue lips or fingernails                  at the hospital you'll be closely watched and given oxygen and more medicines as well as medicines at higher doses than you take at home such treatment can save your life                  asthma treatment for special groups                  the treatments described above generally apply to all people who have asthma however some aspects of treatment differ for people in certain age groups and those who have special needs                  children                  it's hard to diagnose asthma in children younger than 5 years thus it's hard to know whether young children who wheeze or have other asthma symptoms will benefit from long-term control medicines (quick-relief medicines tend to relieve wheezing in young children whether they have asthma or not)                  doctors will treat infants and young children who have asthma symptoms with long-term control medicines if after assessing a child they feel that the symptoms are persistent and likely to continue after 6 years of age (for more information go to how is asthma diagnosed)                  inhaled corticosteroids are the preferred treatment for young children montelukast and cromolyn are other options treatment might be given for a trial period of 1\\xa0month to 6 weeks treatment usually is stopped if benefits aren't seen during that time and the doctor and parents are confident the medicine was used properly                  inhaled corticosteroids can possibly slow the growth of children of all ages slowed growth usually is apparent in the first several months of treatment is generally small and doesn't get worse over time poorly controlled asthma also may reduce a child's growth rate                  many experts think the benefits of inhaled corticosteroids for children who need them to control their asthma far outweigh the risk of slowed growth                  older adults                  doctors may need to adjust asthma treatment for older adults who take certain other medicines such as beta blockers aspirin and other pain relievers and anti-inflammatory medicines these medicines can prevent asthma medicines from working well and may worsen asthma symptoms                  be sure to tell your doctor about all of the medicines you take including over-the-counter medicines                  older adults may develop weak bones from using inhaled corticosteroids especially at high doses talk with your doctor about taking calcium and vitamin d pills as well as other ways to help keep your bones strong                  pregnant women                  pregnant women who have asthma need to control the disease to ensure a good supply of oxygen to their babies poor asthma control increases the risk of preeclampsia a condition in which a pregnant woman develops high blood pressure and protein in the urine poor asthma control also increases the risk that a baby will be born early and have a low birth weight                  studies show that it's safer to take asthma medicines while pregnant than to risk having an asthma attack                  talk with your doctor if you have asthma and are pregnant or planning a pregnancy your level of asthma control may get better or it may get worse while you're pregnant your health care team will check your asthma control often and adjust your treatment as needed                  people whose asthma symptoms occur with physical activity                  physical activity is an important part of a healthy lifestyle adults need physical activity to maintain good health children

be protective for up to 12 hours however with daily use they'll no longer give up to 12 hours of protection also frequent use of these medicines for physical activity might be a sign that asthma is

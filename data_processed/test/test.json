Red cells that\n\t\t\t\t\tdrop rapidly may indicate inflammation in your body.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may also have a test that measures C-reactive protein (CRP), a substance your liver produces when inflammation is present. The same tests may be used to follow your progress during treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBiopsy. The best way to confirm a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is by taking a small sample (biopsy) of the temporal artery. The procedure is performed on an outpatient basis during local anesthesia, usually with little discomfort or scarring. The sample is examined under a microscope in a\n\t\t\t\t\tlaboratory.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have giant cell arteritis, the artery will often show inflammation that includes abnormally large cells, called giant cells, which give the disease its name. It's possible to have giant cell arteritis and still have a negative biopsy result. If the results aren't clear, your doctor may\n\t\t\t\t\tadvise another temporal artery biopsy on the other side of your head.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tImaging tests may be used for diagnosing giant cell arteritis and for monitoring your response to treatment. Possible tests include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMagnetic resonance angiography (MRA). This test combines the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with the use of a contrast material that produces detailed images of your blood vessels. Let your doctor know ahead of time if you're uncomfortable being confined in a small space because the test is\n\t\t\t\t\tconducted in a tube-shaped machine.\n\t\t\t\t\tDoppler ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to produce images of blood flowing through your blood vessels.\n\t\t\t\t\tPositron emission tomography (PET). Using an intravenous tracer solution that contains a tiny amount of radioactive material, a PET scan can produce detailed images of your blood vessels and highlight areas of inflammation.\n\t\t\t\t",
            "GCA treatment usually involves high doses of corticosteroids. Typically, the dose is 40-60 milligrams (mg) per day of prednisone (Deltasone, Orasone, etc.). Headaches and other symptoms quickly decrease with treatment, and the sedimentation rate declines to a normal range.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe high dose of corticosteroids usually continues for a month, and then the dose is slowly decreased. The speed at which your doctor lowers the dose may change if you have recurring symptoms of GCA or large increases in the sedimentation rate. In most cases, though, the prednisone dose can be\n\t\t\t\t\treduced to about 5 - 10 mg per day over a few months. Patients are usually tapered off this medicine by one to two years. GCA rarely returns after treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tActemra (tocilizumab) was approved May 2017 by the FDA to treat adults with giant cell arteritis.\n\t\t\t\t"

Fleming, M.D.\n\t\t\t\t\tFibromyalgia isn't passed directly from parents to children, but the disorder does appear to cluster within families.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe odds of developing fibromyalgia are several times higher in the immediate families of people with fibromyalgia than in families in which no one has fibromyalgia.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, studies of DNA from family members of people with fibromyalgia and other chronic pain syndromes have turned up a number of genes that could help explain why these disorders seem to run in families.\n\t\t\t\t\tEach of these genes plays a role in your nervous system's response to pain. Some of the same genes are also associated with depression and anxiety, which may be the reason why certain antidepressant medications help reduce fibromyalgia symptoms.\n\t\t\t\t",
            "Although the etiology of FM remains unknown, it is thought to involve some combination of genetic susceptibility and environmental exposure that triggers further alterations in gene expression. Because FM shows marked familial aggregation, most previous research has focused on genetic\n\t\t\t\t\tpredisposition to FM and has revealed associations between genetic factors and the development of FM, including specific gene polymorphisms involved in the serotonergic, dopaminergic, and catecholaminergic pathways. The aim of this review was to discuss the current evidence regarding genetic\n\t\t\t\t\tfactors that may play a role in the development and symptom severity of FM.",

Instead, fibromyalgia appears to be linked to changes in how the brain and spinal cord process pain signals.\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause there is no test for fibromyalgia, your doctor must rely solely on your group of symptoms to make a diagnosis.

        "ANSWER": [
            " Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that affects many parts of the body. It is classified as an overgrowth syndrome, which means that affected infants are considerably larger than normal (macrosomia) and tend to be taller than their peers during childhood. Growth begins to slow\n\t\t\t\t\tby about age 8, and adults with this condition are not unusually tall. In some children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, specific parts of the body on one side or the other may grow abnormally large, leading to an asymmetric or uneven appearance. This unusual growth pattern, which is known as\n\t\t\t\t\themihyperplasia, usually becomes less apparent over time.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome vary among affected individuals. Some children with this condition are born with an opening in the wall of the abdomen (an omphalocele) that allows the abdominal organs to protrude through the belly-button. Other abdominal wall defects, such as\n\t\t\t\t\ta soft out-pouching around the belly-button (an umbilical hernia), are also common. Some infants with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome have an abnormally large tongue (macroglossia), which may interfere with breathing, swallowing, and speaking. Other major features of this condition include\n\t\t\t\t\tabnormally large abdominal organs (visceromegaly), creases or pits in the skin near the ears, low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in infancy, and kidney abnormalities.\n\t\t\t\t\tChildren with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome are at an increased risk of developing several types of cancerous and noncancerous tumors, particularly a form of kidney cancer called Wilms tumorand a form of liver cancer called hepatoblastoma. Tumors develop in about 10 percent of people with this condition\n\t\t\t\t\tand almost always appear in childhood.\n\t\t\t\t\tMost children and adults with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome do not have serious medical problems associated with the condition. Their life expectancy is usually normal.\n\t\t\t\t"

LOTS of us with asthma would love help here. Thanks.\n\t\t\t",
        "ANSWER": [
            "\n\t\t\t\t\tExercise-induced bronchoconstriction (EIB), also called exercise-induced asthma, is a narrowing of the airways in the lungs that is triggered by physical activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tEIB is common in patients with chronic asthma, who frequently experience flare-ups while exercising. But it can also occur in otherwise healthy individuals who experience asthma symptoms only when they exercise.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSymptoms of Exercise-Induced Asthma\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you have EIB, you may have problems breathing within five to 20 minutes after exercise. Symptoms of EIB are similar to those of chronic asthma, but the timing of the symptoms is closely linked with physical activity.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYour symptoms may include:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Wheezing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Tight chest\n\t\t\t\t\t* Cough\n\t\t\t\t\t* Shortness of breath\n\t\t\t\t\t* Chest pain (rarely)\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTriggers\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople with EIB are typically very sensitive to both low temperatures and dry air. Air is usually warmed and humidified by the nose, but during demanding activity people breathe more through their mouths. This allows cold, dry air to reach your lower airways and your lungs without passing through\n\t\t\t\t\tyour nose, triggering asthma symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAir pollutants, high pollen levels and viral respiratory infections may also be triggers. Other causes of symptoms while exercising include being out of shape, poorly controlled nasal allergies or vocal cord issues.\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the sport you choose can affect your symptoms. Swimming is considered less likely to cause asthma symptoms because the warm, humid environment of the pool does not aggravate the airways. Warm-weather activities and those requiring only short bursts of energy are also recommended. These\n\t\t\t\t\tinclude:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Hiking\n\t\t\t\t\t* Baseball\n\t\t\t\t\t* Golf\n\t\t\t\t\t* Walking\n\t\t\t\t\t* Leisure biking\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause cold, dry air can make symptoms worse, as can activities that require continuous exertion, it is recommended that individuals with EIB avoid sports like:\n\t\t\t\t\t* Cross-country skiing\n\t\t\t\t\t* Running\n\t\t\t\t\t* Soccer\n\t\t\t\t\t* Basketball\n\t\t\t\t\t* Hockey\n\n\t\t\t\t",
            " Fortunately, having asthma, even exercise-induced asthma, doesn't have to keep you out of the game. In fact, as many as one in 12 Olympic athletes take asthma medication.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe trick is to make sure asthma is well controlled with medication and to choose your activity carefully. Some are good choices, others may be more of a challenge. ...\n\t\t\t\t\tOne recent study found that adults who walked three times a week for 12 weeks actually improved asthma control and fitness levels without provoking an attack. ...\n\t\t\t\t\tOne study found that people who practiced Hatha yoga two-and-a-half hours a week for 10 weeks were able to cut down on their asthma medication. The same benefit would probably result from Tai Chi, a martial art that also emphasizes breathing, says Dr. Graham. ...\n\t\t\t\t"

In about 30 percent of patients who undergo ablation of chronic atrial fibrillation, the atrial fibrillation is replaced by a different kind of short circuit referred to as \"left atrial\n\t\t\t\t\tflutter.\" These patients are treated temporarily with medications and the left atrial flutter sometimes goes away on its own within a few months. If it does not, you may need a second catheter ablation procedure to eliminate the flutter. In these cases, the overall success rate is approximately\n\t\t\t\t\t75-85 percent. If the atrial fibrillation has been persistent for more than 1-2 years, almost all patients will require more than one ablation procedure before a normal heart rhythm is restored.\n\t\t\t\t",

        "ANSWER": [
            " Scientists have identified 5 unique hepatitis viruses, identified by the letters A, B, C, D, and E. While all cause liver disease, they vary in important ways.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis A virus (HAV) is present in the faeces of infected persons and is most often transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. Certain sex practices can also spread HAV. Infections are in many cases mild, with most people making a full recovery and remaining immune from further\n\t\t\t\t\tHAV infections. However, HAV infections can also be severe and life threatening. Most people in areas of the world with poor sanitation have been infected with this virus. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HAV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis B virus (HBV) is transmitted through exposure to infective blood, semen, and other body fluids. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to infants at the time of birth or from family member to infant in early childhood. Transmission may also occur through transfusions of HBV-contaminated\n\t\t\t\t\tblood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. HBV also poses a risk to healthcare workers who sustain accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent HBV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis C virus (HCV) is mostly transmitted through exposure to infective blood. This may happen through transfusions of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products, contaminated injections during medical procedures, and through injection drug use. Sexual transmission is also possible, but is\n\t\t\t\t\tmuch less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis D virus (HDV) infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. The dual infection of HDV and HBV can result in a more serious disease and worse outcome. Hepatitis B vaccines provide protection from HDV infection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHepatitis E virus (HEV) is mostly transmitted through consumption of contaminated water or food. HEV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and is increasingly recognized as an important cause of disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines to prevent\n\t\t\t\t\tHEV infection have been developed but are not widely available.\n\t\t\t\t",

            " Itchy Crotch Cause: Fungal Infections\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll likely develop a rash along with the itching, though its appearance varies depending on the type of fungus causing it. For instance, if a yeast infection is responsible, you may notice moist, shiny areas of skin on your penis, and possibly some white stuff in the\n\t\t\t\t\tskin folds, along with the red, itchy rash, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYeast is normally present in small amounts on your skin, but an overgrowth of it can cause an infection. This tends to occur in moist places that don't get much light, says Jason Reichenberg, M.D., director of dermatology at the University of Texas Austin. So it usually shows up on the sides of your\n\t\t\t\t\tgroin, between your genitals and thighs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOther fungal infections look a little different: They appear dry and flaky, and usually crop up on your thighs, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Whatever the type of fungus responsible for your itching, an antifungal cream like Lotrimin AF should do the trick. The cream attacks the fungal cells that cause the infection, while leaving your healthy skin cells unscathed.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPat the region dry before rubbing on the cream. That will help get rid moisture, keeping the fungus from growing and allowing the cream to work better, Dr. Reichenberg says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Chafing\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Chafing occurs when your skin rubs together-commonly your thighs. It usually develops when you're doing an activity that involves a lot of friction, like running.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rubbing can disturb your skin barrier, causing tiny cracks and inflammation on your outer layers of skin. This causes a red, irritated rash that burns and itches. Your skin can also grow scaly, too, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Your goal is to protect your irritated skin and prevent any additional rubbing. A moisturizer like Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Cream will help repair the skin. It also contains colloidal oatmeal, which works to soothe irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPair that with a zinc cream, like Destin, which protects your skin from future rubbing by adding a protective barrier. And then use a cream that contains petroleum, like CeraVe Healing Ointment, which helps hydrate and restore your skin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Intertrigo\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: You'll develop a raw, red rash that itches and stings, usually in areas that contain lots of moisture from sweating, Dr. Zeichner says-so, like your groin, between the folds of your stomach, under your arms, or between your toes, according to the Mayo Clinic. That\n\t\t\t\t\tmoisture can spur an overgrowth of bacteria and fungus.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Antibacterial creams like Neosporin and antifungal creams, like Lotrimin, can take care of the bacteria and fungus. And a zinc cream, like Destin, shields your skin from more rubbing.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the rash persists for one to two weeks, head to your dermatologist. He or she will likely prescribe stronger versions of these medications to smooth over the irritation, Dr. Zeichner says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Contact Dermatitis\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Contact dermatitis occurs when your skin comes in contact with something it's allergic to. You'll likely develop a super itchy, red rash that looks bumpy. It might even ooze a clear or yellowish fluid, which shows that the top layer of your skin has been disrupted, says\n\t\t\t\t\tDr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tContact dermatitis is likely the cause if you notice that itchy rash and you've recently changed something in your routine-say, you tried a new laundry detergent or fabric softener, or even bought a new couch made of a different material-right before you noticed it, says Dr. Reichenberg. You'll\n\t\t\t\t\tusually start to notice a reaction hours or even a few days later.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou'll also probably experience itching on other body parts that were exposed to the allergen, too, he says. Your itchy balls will likely bother you more, though, since their thin skin is more sensitive to allergens.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Stop using the chemical or material you think may be responsible. If it's clothing washed in a new detergent, rewash it a few times with your previous brand, says Dr. Reichenberg.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf contact dermatitis was responsible, the reaction should disappear in about two weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Pubic lice\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: If you start to notice intense itching, irritation, and tiny specks in your pubic hair, you might have contracted a type of parasite called pubic lice, also known as crabs.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tYou may see tiny white or yellowish specks near the roots of your pubic hair. Those are the lice eggs, says Dennis Fortenberry, M.D., a professor of adolescent medicine at Indiana University. You might also spot the lice themselves crawling-they're tan or grayish-white, and if you're brave enough\n\t\t\t\t\tto look at one through a magnifying glass, it'd resemble a mini crab, reports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: Head to your doctor-he or she will confirm that your problem actually is lice, and send you home with a shampoo or lotion containing either permethrin or pyrethrins with piperonyl butoxide, which will kill the lice Dr. Fortenberry says.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Herpes\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: For some guys, itching can be the first symptom of this sexually transmitted infection (STI), which is caused by the herpes virus, Dr. Fortenberry says. That itch will usually turn to burning, and within about a day, a blister or cluster of blisters can form. Then, the\n\t\t\t\t\tblisters can break, leading to painful sores.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you've experienced those symptoms in the past and they keep cropping back up, that might point to herpes, since the infection usually causes recurrent outbreaks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: This is another case where you'll head to your doctor. He or she will diagnose you, either by simply looking at the appearance of your blisters or by performing a blood test or culture of the lesion, reports the CDC.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThere's no cure for herpes, but your doctor can provide some treatment. Antiviral meds, like Valtrex, Zovirax, or Famvir, can shorten the outbreak or prevent one from occurring. They also may reduce the chances of passing on the virus to your partner.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tItchy Crotch Cause: Genital Warts\n\t\t\t\t\tHow you know you have it: Genital warts are a common symptom of the STI human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically soft to the touch and skin colored, and some may even resemble a cauliflower. You might notice just one, or they could crop up in a cluster, Dr. Fortenberry says. But other than\n\t\t\t\t\tsome itching, the warts don't feel like anything.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHow to treat it: If you think you have genital warts, check in with your doctor, Dr. Fortenberry says. He or she will likely prescribe a medication that contains Imiquimod, Podofilox, or Sinecatechins, which will stimulate your body's immune system to clear up the warts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOr, she may apply liquid nitrogen to the growth, which will freeze it off.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, even though you can get rid of the wart, you can't eliminate the virus from your system-meaning more warts could crop up down the road, and you can still spread it to others if you don't have a visible wart.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThis article originally appeared on MensHealth.com.\n\t\t\t\t"

        "ANSWER": [
            "When a person is infested with scabies mites the first time, symptoms may not appear for up to two months after being infested. However, an infested person can transmit scabies, even if they do not have symptoms. Scabies usually is passed by direct, prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an\n\t\t\t\t\tinfested person. However, a person with crusted (Norwegian) scabies can spread the infestation by brief skin-to-skin contact or by exposure to bedding, clothing, or even furniture that he/she has used.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tScabies is prevented by avoiding direct skin-to-skin contact with an infested person or with items such as clothing or bedding used by an infested person. Scabies treatment usually is recommended for members of the same household, particularly for those who have had prolonged skin-to-skin contact. All\n\t\t\t\t\thousehold members and other potentially exposed persons should be treated at the same time as the infested person to prevent possible reexposure and reinfestation. Bedding and clothing worn or used next to the skin anytime during the 3 days before treatment should be machine washed and dried\n\t\t\t\t\tusing the hot water and hot dryer cycles or be dry-cleaned. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing in a closed plastic bag for several days to a week. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin. Children and adults\n\t\t\t\t\tusually can return to child care, school, or work the day after treatment.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPersons with crusted scabies and their close contacts, including household members, should be treated rapidly and aggressively to avoid outbreaks. Institutional outbreaks can be difficult to control and require a rapid, aggressive, and sustained response.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRooms used by a patient with crusted scabies should be thoroughly cleaned and vacuumed after use.\n\t\t\t\t",
            "Products used to treat scabies are called scabicides because they kill scabies mites; some also kill mite eggs. Scabicides used to treat human scabies are available only with a doctor's prescription. No \"over-the-counter\" (non-prescription) products have been tested and approved to treat\n\t\t\t\t\tscabies.\n\t\t\t\t\tScabicide lotion or cream should be applied to all areas of the body from the neck down to the feet and toes. In addition, when treating infants and young children, scabicide lotion or cream also should be applied to their entire head and neck because scabies can affect their face, scalp, and neck, as\n\t\t\t\t\twell as the rest of their body. Only permethrin or sulfur ointment may be used in infants. The lotion or cream should be applied to a clean body and left on for the recommended time before washing it off. Clean clothing should be worn after treatment. Both sexual and close personal contacts who\n\t\t\t\t\thave had direct prolonged skin-to-skin contact with an infested person within the preceding month should be examined and treated. All persons should be treated at the same time to prevent reinfestation.\n\t\t\t\t",
            "\n\t\t\t\t\tScabies treatment involves eliminating the infestation with medications. Several creams and lotions are available with a doctor's prescription. You usually apply the medication over all your body, from your neck down, and leave the medication on for at least eight hours. A second treatment is needed\n\t\t\t\t\tif new burrows and rash appear.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause scabies spreads so easily, your doctor will likely recommend treatment for all household members and other close contacts, even if they show no signs of scabies infestation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMedications commonly prescribed for scabies include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPermethrin cream, 5 percent (Elimite). Permethrin is a topical cream that contains chemicals that kill scabies mites and their eggs. It is generally considered safe for adults, pregnant women, and children ages 2 months and older. This medicine is not recommended for nursing mothers.\n\t\t\t\t\tLindane lotion. This medication - also a chemical treatment - is recommended only for people who can't tolerate other approved treatments, or for whom other treatments didn't work. This medication isn't safe for children younger than age 2 years, women who are pregnant or nursing, the elderly, or\n\t\t\t\t\tanyone who weighs less than 110 pounds (50 kilograms).\n\t\t\t\t\tCrotamiton (Eurax). This medication is available as a cream or a lotion. It's applied once a day for two days. This medication isn't recommended for children or for women who are pregnant or nursing. Frequent treatment failure has been reported with crotamiton.\n\t\t\t\t\tIvermectin (Stromectol). Doctors may prescribe this oral medication for people with altered immune systems, for people who have crusted scabies, or for people who don't respond to the prescription lotions and creams. Ivermectin isn't recommended for women who are pregnant or nursing, or for children who\n\t\t\t\t\tweigh less than 33 pounds (15 kg).\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough these medications kill the mites promptly, you may find that the itching doesn't stop entirely for several weeks.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDoctors may prescribe other topical medications, such as sulfur compounded in petrolatum, for people who don't respond to or can't use these medications.\n\t\t\t\t"

The PHEX gene is located on the X chromosome, which is one of the two sex chromosomes. In females\n\t\t\t\t\t(who have two X chromosomes), a mutation in one of the two copies of the gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. In males (who have only one X chromosome), a mutation in the only copy of the gene in each cell causes the disorder.\n\t\t\t\t\tLess commonly, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets can have an X-linked recessive pattern of inheritance. This form of the condition is often called Dent disease. Like the PHEX gene, the gene associated with Dent disease is located on the X chromosome. In males, one altered copy of the gene in each\n\t\t\t\t\tcell is sufficient to cause the condition. In females, a mutation would have to occur in both copies of the gene to cause the disorder. Because it is unlikely that females will have two altered copies of this gene, males are affected by X-linked recessive disorders much more frequently than\n\t\t\t\t\tfemales.\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a few families, hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets has had an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, which means one copy of an altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. The rare condition HHRH has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, which means both copies of\n\t\t\t\t\ta gene in each cell have mutations.\n\t\t\t\t",

            "MTHFR gene mutation is a genetic change that affects an enzyme involved in breaking down the amino acid homocysteine.[1][2][3] C677T and A1298C are two very common MTHFR gene changes.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople with MTHFR gene mutations may develop elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood (homocysteinemia) or urine (homocystinuria). Risks for health effects vary depending on the levels of homocysteine.[5]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh homocysteine levels in the body may occur if the MTHFR enzyme is not functioning normally due to MTHFR mutations such as C677T and A1298C. Elevated levels of homocysteine can also occur if there is a lack of folate or B vitamins. Homocysteine levels also tend to rise with age, smoking, and use\n\t\t\t\t\tof certain drugs (such as carbamazepine, methotrexate, and phenytoin).[13][14]\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is important to ensure that people with and without MTHFR gene mutations receive adequate amounts of folate, choline, and B vitamins (B12, B6, and riboflavin) to mitigate health risks. If adequate nutrition cannot be attained through diet alone, supplementation with folate (e.g., levomefolate\n\t\t\t\t\t(5-methyl THF) or folinic acid) and B vitamins is considered.[3][13] Speak to a healthcare professional if you have questions about your nutrition or need for vitamin supplementation.\n\n\t\t\t\t",
            "\n\t\t\t\t\tOutlook (Prognosis)\n\t\t\t\t\tAlthough no cure exists for homocystinuria, vitamin B therapy can help about half of people affected by the condition.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the diagnosis is made in childhood, starting a low-methionine diet quickly may prevent some intellectual disability and other complications of the disease. For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPossible Complications\n\t\t\t\t\tMost serious complications result from blood clots.

        "ANSWER": [
            "\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The long-term outlook (prognosis) and life expectancy for people with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) varies. The prognosis largely depends on whether there is severe autoimmune disease; whether there are recurrent infections that cause structural lung damage; and the development of a\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancy (cancer). Other major factors that influence prognosis include the extent of organ damage and how successfully infections can be prevented.\n\t\t\t\t\tAffected people who have only bacterial infections have a better prognosis than those with additional complications and can have nearly normal life expectancy. This is especially the case if they are diagnosed early and begin treatment soon after the onset of symptoms.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. In some cases, abnormal growth of small nodules of lymphoid tissue in the gastrointestinal tract (nodular lymphoid hyperplasia) may occur. In addition, an increased percent of individuals with CVID are more prone to developing certain forms of cancer than the general population such as\n\t\t\t\t\tmalignancies of lymphatic tissue (lymphoma) and possibly stomach cancer). The risk of gastric carcinoma is almost 50 times greater in patients with CVID than in other individuals.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIn addition, some individuals with CVID may develop granular, inflammatory nodules (noncaseating granulomas) within tissue of the skin, lungs, spleen, and/or liver.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Of the 411 subjects with known follow-up (87% of the cohort), 93 patients (19.6%) had died.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe median age at death was 44 years for females (range 10-90 years) and 42 years for\n\t\t\t\t\tmales (range 9-79 years), not significantly different. The predominant causes of death\n\t\t\t\t\tincluded respiratory failure from chronic lung disease, lymphoid or other malignancy, or\n\t\t\t\t\toverwhelming infections (TABLE 6). To further examine the mortality of this cohort, we\n\t\t\t\t\tcompared those with known long term follow-up, 226 females (48%) and 185 males (39%)\n\t\t\t\t\tto age-matched population controls. The survival of both male (p=0.0001) and female\n\t\t\t\t\t(p=0.0001) CVID subjects was significantly reduced as compared to 1994 United States\n\t\t\t\t\treference information.34 (FIGURE 1) The risk of death in this interval was nearly 11 times\n\t\t\t\t\thigher for CVID patients with one or more of the non-infectious complications, than for\n\t\t\t\t\tsubjects who had infections only (HR=10.96; p=0.0001) (TABLE 7). Kaplan-Meier Analysis\n\t\t\t\t\tconfirmed this observation, with a long term survival of 95% for patients without versus 42%\n\t\t\t\t\tfor those with non-infectious complications (FIGURE 2). These data agree with a previous\n\t\t\t\t\tstudy on CVID subjects from the ESID registry.7\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, we found here that not all complications were associated with reduced survival.

The milder forms of osteogenesis imperfecta, including type I, are characterized by bone fractures during childhood and adolescence that often result from minor trauma. Fractures occur less frequently in adulthood. People with mild forms of the condition typically have a blue or grey tint to\n\t\t\t\t\tthe part of the eye that is usually white (the sclera), and may develop hearing loss in adulthood.

        "ANSWER": [
            " 1. Trisomy 7 is extremely rare at birth and is generally considered lethal in embryogenesis. All surviving children are mosaics with variable and nonspecific clinical features. Chromosomal mosaicism may be suggested by body asymmetry and/or Blaschkolinear skin pigmentary dysplasia\n\t\t\t\t\tassociated with developmental delay. Cultured skin fibroblasts cytogenetic analysis confirms mosaicism and identifies its chromosomal origin. In amniocytes, trisomy 7 is frequently a cell culture artifact leading to single- or multiple-cell pseudomosaicism with normal fetal outcome.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. 7q11.23 duplication syndrome is considered to be an autosomal dominant condition, which means one copy of chromosome 7 with the duplication in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Most cases result from a duplication that occurs during the formation of reproductive cells (eggs and\n\t\t\t\t\tsperm) or in early fetal development. These cases occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family. Less commonly, an affected person inherits the chromosome with a duplicated segment from a parent.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Rearrangements of chromosomes include deletions of DNA sequences and duplications of segments, both of which can encompass thousands to hundreds of thousands of bases. Why do these large rearrangements occur? For one, certain structural features of the genome, also referred to as genome\n\t\t\t\t\tarchitecture, can render various regions fragile and thus prone to events such as chromosome breakage, which often result in translocations, deletions, and duplications. Often, these alterations happen due to errors during cell division when chromosomes align (Figure 1). Homologous\n\t\t\t\t\trecombination between areas of concentrated repeated sequences frequently creates deletions and duplications. Because they commonly involve more than one gene, the disorders caused by these large deletion and duplication mutations are often severe.\n\n\t\t\t\t"

Most heart attacks occur as a result of coronary heart disease (CHD).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Endocarditis (EN-do-kar-DI-tis) is an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. This lining is called the endocardium (en-do-KAR-de-um). The condition also is called infective endocarditis (IE).\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe term \"endocarditis\" also is used to describe an inflammation of the endocardium due to other conditions. This article only discusses endocarditis related to infection.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIE occurs if bacteria, fungi, or other germs invade your bloodstream and attach to abnormal areas of your heart. The infection can damage your heart and cause serious and sometimes fatal complications.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIE can develop quickly or slowly; it depends on what type of germ is causing it and whether you have an underlying heart problem. When IE develops quickly, it's called acute infective endocarditis. When it develops slowly, it's called subacute infective endocarditis.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tOverview\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIE mainly affects people who have:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tDamaged or artificial (man-made) heart valves\n\t\t\t\t\tCongenital heart defects (defects present at birth)\n\t\t\t\t\tImplanted medical devices in the heart or blood vessels\n\t\t\t\t\tPeople who have normal heart valves also can have IE. However, the condition is much more common in people who have abnormal hearts.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tCertain factors make it easier for bacteria to enter your bloodstream.

        "ANSWER": [
            " 1. The defining characteristics of syncope include rapid onset with transient loss of consciousness usually accompanied by falling, followed by spontaneous, complete, and usually prompt recovery without intervention. Because some patients use the term dizziness to describe syncopal\n\t\t\t\t\tevents, it is important to ask patients exactly what they mean by dizziness and whether loss of consciousness occurred.\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSyncope must be differentiated from vertigo, coma, drop attacks, dizziness, sudden cardiac death, and seizures. Vertigo (i.e., sensation of movement) does not include loss of consciousness. Coma involves loss of consciousness without spontaneous recovery. Drop attacks involve sudden falls without loss\n\t\t\t\t\tof consciousness or warning and with immediate recovery. Drop attacks may be idiopathic but also have several specific causes (e.g., underlying cardiovascular disease, spondylotic osteophytes or colloidal cysts that transiently block the vertebral arteries or cerebral aqueduct, vertebrobasilar\n\t\t\t\t\tstroke). The typical signs of epileptic seizures include dejavu, tongue lacerations, limb jerking, and postictal confusion but not common signs of syncope, such as prodromal diaphoresis, palpitations, or provocation by prolonged sitting or standing. Although limb jerking is noted in 15 percent\n\t\t\t\t\tof syncopal patients, the other typical signs of seizures are absent.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Correct and early diagnosis of TIA versus mimics is critical because early interventions (e.g., antiplatelet agents, statin therapy, blood pressure-lowering therapy, anticoagulation when appropriate) can lead to an 80 percent reduction in risk of recurrent ischemic events. The most common TIA\n\t\t\t\t\tmimics are seizures, migraines, metabolic disturbances, and syncope. Mimics are more likely with gradual onset of symptoms and with nonspecific symptoms (Table 113), such as memory loss or headache.\n\n\t\t\t\t"

        "ANSWER": [
            " The recommended starting dose for Effexor is 75 mg/day, administered in two or three divided doses, taken with food. Depending on tolerability and the need for further clinical effect, the dose may be increased to 150 mg/day. If needed, the dose should be further increased up to 225\n\t\t\t\t\tmg/day. When increasing the dose, increments of up to 75 mg/day should be made at intervals of no less than 4 days. In outpatient settings there was no evidence of usefulness of doses greater than 225 mg/day for moderately depressed patients, but more severely depressed inpatients responded to\n\t\t\t\t\ta mean dose of 350 mg/day. Certain patients, including more severely depressed patients, may therefore respond more to higher doses, up to a maximum of 375 mg/day, generally in three divided doses ",
            "Antidepressants most likely to cause sexual side effects include:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which include citalopram (Celexa), escitalopram (Lexapro), fluoxetine (Prozac, Selfemra), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva) and sertraline (Zoloft).\n\t\t\t\t\tSerotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which include venlafaxine (Effexor XR), desvenlafaxine (Pristiq, Khedezla) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).\n\t\t\t\t\tTricyclic and tetracyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, nortriptyline (Pamelor) and clomipramine (Anafranil).\n\t\t\t\t\tMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), such as isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil) and tranylcypromine (Parnate). However, selegiline (Emsam), a newer MAOI that you stick on your skin as a patch, has a low risk of sexual side effects.\n\t\t\t\t\tIf you're taking an antidepressant that causes sexual side effects, your doctor may recommend one of these strategies:\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWaiting several weeks to see whether sexual side effects get better.\n\t\t\t\t\tEngaging in sexual activity before taking an antidepressant if your antidepressant requires a once-a-day dose.\n\t\t\t\t\tAdjusting the dose of your antidepressant to reduce the risk of sexual side effects. But always talk with your doctor before changing your dose.\n\t\t\t\t\tSwitching to another antidepressant that may be less likely to cause sexual side effects.\n\t\t\t\t\tAdding a second antidepressant or another type of medication to counter sexual side effects. For example, the addition of the antidepressant bupropion or the anti-anxiety medication buspirone may ease sexual side effects caused by an antidepressant.\n\t\t\t\t\tAdding a medication to improve sexual function, such as sildenafil (Viagra, Revatio), tadalafil (Adcirca, Cialis) or vardenafil (Levitra, Staxyn). Although these medications are used to treat sexual problems in men, initial research suggests sildenafil may also improve sexual problems caused by\n\t\t\t\t\tantidepressants in some women.\n\t\t\t\t"

            " Non-aspirin NSAID use was associated with an increased risk of mild/moderate ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.02) and aspirin use was associated with an increased risk of severe ED (HR 1.16; P = 0.03, respectively).
